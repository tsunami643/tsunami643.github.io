<ul><li><p>You can deny yourself using Mist Coil.
</li></p><li><p>The self-damage on Mist Coil can be absorbed by Aphotic Shield and can heal you during Borrowed Time.
</li></p><li><p>Mist Coil can heal and damage siege creeps.
</li></p><li><p>You can put Aphotic Shield on siege creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Aphotic Shield will always detonate for the full damage regardless of damage absorbed. This means that you can replace a shield on an ally to detonate it on demand for the damage.
</li></p><li><p>Abaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to cast the shield, but if you've got them arteezy reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.
</li></p><li><p>If you get attacked by a hero while you have Aphotic Shield on, the game still acts like you've taken damage from that hero. This means that salves, clarities, bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, Recall, and sleeps all get canceled.
</li></p><li><p>You don't need to actually complete an attack to get the Curse of Avernus buff. During chases or escapes, you can animation cancel an attack on a neutral or a creep to give yourself a free 15% move speed bonus without having to wait through Abaddon's full attack animation. If you have Tranquils this is doubly important since it allows you to get the move speed buff without breaking your boots.
</li></p><li><p>Curse of Avernus works on towers.
</li></p><li><p>Aphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.
</li></p><li><p>Borrowed Time can be activated manually to disjoint projectiles (like stuns) or you can manually cast it while stunned to purge it off.
</li></p><li><p>The self-damage taken from Armlet can heal you under Borrowed Time. This is a bug.
</li></p><li><p>Abaddon is an ideal hero to keep auras on (Vlad's, Basi, Drum, Shiva's) since he takes too much time for teams to kill early on in a fight.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>The burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge (675).
</li></p><li><p>If you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever triggering.
</li></p><li><p>If you don't trust your team, Eul's is a great Abaddon counter since it can waste 2.5s of Borrowed Time.
</li></p><li><p>AA's Ice Blast prevents Abaddon from healing during Borrowed Time.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="1"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/alchemist_full.png" alt="Alchemist"></span><span id=name>Alchemist</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Try to catch people in your Acid Spray if you're about to stun them. Besides the fact that they'll take damage over time by being stunned in the spray, the spray lowers armor significantly and Unstable Concoction deals physical damage. A 360 damage physical nuke is good, but a 360 damage physical nuke with a ton of minus armor is even better.
</li></p><li><p>After 5 seconds, Unstable Concoction reaches its max damage/stun time. So you don't need to wait for 0.5s left on the timer, you can throw it at ~2.0s for the same effect.
</li></p><li><p>Be aware that enemies can see the Concoction countdown timer as of 6.84.
</li></p><li><p>If you're teleporting into a fight, try casting Unstable Concoction before you start the TP. That way you'll have a pre-cooked stun the second you show up.
</li></p><li><p>With exceptional timing, you can dodge the self-stun on a failed Concoction by activating Chemical Rage at the moment of detonation. This works against enemy projectile stuns as well.
</li></p><li><p>You can use Unstable Concoction's self-detonate to deny yourself.
</li></p><li><p>You get 25 seconds between stacks on Greevil's Greed. If you're freefarming, you should be hitting 30 gold CONSTANTLY. If you're jungling, learn how to strategically draw aggro from neutral creeps using Acid Spray to keep stacks up.
</li></p><li><p>If you're starved for mana and you're sitting on a Basi ring, disassemble it if you're Chemically Raged. The bonus mana regen you're getting from your ult is counted as base mana regen, thus a percentage based item (such as the Sage Mask) from your Basi ring will regen mana quicker than a flat regen item (such as the full Basilius.)
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Unstable Concoction detonates in a small AoE. Don't give your teammate a hug if they're about to get hit by the Concoction because it'll stun both of you. Similarly, if you have Alchemist disabled, beware of it self-detonating on Alchemist. It'll stun you if you're standing too close to him.
</li></p><li><p>Just because you think the DoT from Acid Spray isn't hurting you that much doesn't mean you should stand around in it. Acid Spray drops your armor substantially, which makes it extremely tempting for someone like a TA or Bounty Hunter to walk in and pop your ass.
</li></p><li><p>Alchemist himself has pretty garbage armor, so armor-debuffing spells and items are great for killing him through Chemical Rage.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="2"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/ancient_apparition_full.png" alt="Ancient Apparition"></span><span id=name>Ancient Apparition</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>The reason Eul's is considered core on AA is because Cold Feet+Cyclone pretty much assures that an enemy won't be able to run out of the Cold Feet trigger radius. However, a lot of AAs go tunnel vision when finding a high priority target and try to pull this combo on them. As a result, you probably just Cycloned an enemy Phantom Assassin out of Ravage because you were being a greedy bitch. In chases and ganks, the Cyclone+Cold Feet can be useful, but avoid using it in team fights. If anything, save the Cyclone for yourself.
</li></p><li><p>Ice Vortex is more than a massive range slow. It's also a 275 radius Veil of Discord that lowers magic resistance. Throw them all over the place when you're pushing and try to ult people when they're sitting in a Vortex for massive damage. Keep this in mind if you're skilling Chilling Touch as well, since Chilling Touch deals Magical damage.
</li></p><li><p>Ice Vortex is also a great scouting tool with the vision it provides. Use it to scout out Rosh attempts or to check high ground or to help with counterwarding.
</li></p><li><p>Ice Blast is a great way to break Blink Daggers for 8+3/9+3/10+3 seconds or 17+3 with Agh (the +3 is the time it takes for the Dagger to unbreak after the last tick of damage). You don't even need to land the Blast. As long as they get the Frostbite debuff, an enemy's Dagger will stay broken for the whole duration. Use it before team fights on an enemy initiator.
</li></p><li><p>You or your allies can remove the Chilling Touch buff by clicking on the buff icon.
</li></p><li><p>Shoot your ult farther than you think it should go in most short range encounters. The shatter debuff can be more useful than the nuke in some situations, and as long as an enemy along the path of the projectile, they'll get frosted. Plus, the Ice Blast projectile travels slow as hell at low ranges and it's very easy for people to retreat the second they see it.</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're walking back to the fountain at low HP and an enemy AA is alive, take a short break and try to bait the Ice Blast. It's worth spending a few extra seconds standing at your rax rather than risking getting blasted in your fountain.
</li></p><li><p>His ult is famous for having the game's most confusing tooltip. If you're against an AA, all you need to know is that if his ult flew over your head, you have a debuff that won't let you heal any HP. No lifesteal, no fountain regen, no Tranquil Boots, no Urn of Shadows, no PYOORIFICAYSHUN. Just you sitting and praying you don't drop below the shattering threshold.</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="3"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/antimage_full.png" alt="Anti-Mage"></span><span id=name>Anti‑Mage</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Blink into the trees! If you're getting ganked, always assume that there is someone behind you, waiting for you to blink back into the lane/jungle to retreat. You have a stupid low cooldown on blink. Blink into the trees, watch four heroes suddenly materialize from the fog struggling to find you, then quietly blink along the treeline until you're sure you're safe.
</li></p><li><p>Mana Void comes with a free ministun. Don't keep slicing at people if you see them channeling something, just cancel it.
</li></p><li><p>Left click on an enemy hero to check their mana pool before Mana Voiding them. You may even be able to get a kill without doing any right clicking if you show up at the right time.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Shadow Demon is a notable counter against AM since the illusions created by Disruption will mana burn him.
</li></p><li><p>Try not to stack disables when ganking AM. Stuns and silences are invaluable when you're trying to kill him, but you need to stagger them appropriately otherwise he'll blink out.
</li></p><li><p>A Ghost Scepter can save your life if you're a support and the fun is over.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="4"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/axe_full.png" alt="Axe"></span><span id=name>Axe</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Berserker's Call goes through spell immunity. If you see a BKB'd Shadow Fiend having an epileptic fit while he's casting his ult, walk up and Q him.
</li></p><li><p>Just because you don't catch anyone in Berserker's Call doesn't mean the spell was a bust. You get +40 armor during its duration which can easily make the difference between life and death early game during tower dives.
</li></p><li><p>Berserker's Call is a handy way to break an enemy's invisibility. If an enemy Clinkz just ran away with 10 HP, try Blinking into where you think he'll be and cast Call. If you're right, they'll be forced to attack you and lose their invis.
</li></p><li><p>Battle Hunger is a great spell for disabling Blink Daggers, especially when breaking high ground.
</li></p><li><p>You can Cull any enemy unit, including creeps. While this is usually irrelevant, it can be worth Culling a creep to get the massive 40% AoE movement speed buff to catch up to an enemy.
</li></p><li><p>You can instagib flying or walking couriers at any level of Culling Blade since couriers are always below the damage threshold.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Battle Hunger can be taken off by denies. If your lane mate is being a hungry hungry hippo with last hits, focus your energy on landing a deny.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to who is Battle Hungered late game. Let poor old Witch Doctor get a last hit instead of taking unnecessary damage.
</li></p><li><p>Culling Blade goes through Dazzle's Shallow Grave. It can also kill Rosh. Culling Blade don't care.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="5"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/bane_full.png" alt="Bane"></span><span id=name>Bane</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Enfeeble is outrageous early game. It's tempting to spend a majority of your mana constantly Brain Sapping, but it can be more useful to completely stop your lane enemy from getting a single last hit rather than forcing them to use and buy regen.
</li></p><li><p>No one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga sleep. If anyone right clicks this hero after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spell is used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will not be transferred.
</li></p><li><p>You can use that first second of complete immunity on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from taking any damage.
</li></p><li><p>Nightmare can be used to deny allies or yourself since it applies a very small DoT.
</li></p><li><p>You can dispel Nightmares on yourself by using the Nightmare End skill.
</li></p><li><p>Like all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade to go invis during the channel or use BKB.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>TAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES. If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmare'd ally.
</li></p><li><p>Use summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster boar, Lycan wolf, Brood spiderling, or Prophet treant, even illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the Nightmare.
</li></p><li><p>Fiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to break the channel on Bane's ult.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="6"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/batrider_full.png" alt="Batrider"></span><span id=name>Batrider</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't just toss Napalms casually. Go out of your way to make sure you're keeping stacks up on the enemy hero. The difference between 2 stacks and 4 stacks can be the difference between suggesting the enemy eat a tango or go back to the fountain.
</li></p><li><p>You can click on an enemy hero to see how many Magic Stick/Wand charges they have. If they're sitting on 10, it's probably a bad idea to go for a kill.
</li></p><li><p>Napalm is relevant all game long because turn speed is relevant all game long. Just because you're not laning anymore doesn't mean you should stop using the spell. It still gives vision, it still raises your damage, and it's still annoying as hell to have to turn in bullet time.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to the buff icon timer for Firefly. When it ends you need to make sure you won't be stuck somewhere you don't want to be.
</li></p><li><p>Don't feel obligated to drag someone as far as you can when you Flaming Lasso someone. If your team is nearby or you're 1v1ing, your time may be spent better trying to lay on additional Napalm stacks.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Buy a Magic Stick ASAP against this fool. You can get one from the side shop.
</li></p><li><p>Once you get 3-4 stacks of Napalm on you, back off and let the debuff wear off. You can check how many stacks you have by looking at your current debuffs.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="7"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/beastmaster_full.png" alt="Beastmaster"></span><span id=name>Beastmaster</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're offlaning, use your Axes to cut down the treeline next to you to improve your vision.
</li></p><li><p>Since Wild Axes deal physical damage, you can use them to damage ancients.
</li></p><li><p>For some reason, the Boar does not draw aggro from creeps. This means that you can have the Boar spit at an enemy hero all day and they'll have to kill it themselves.
</li></p><li><p>The Boar slow goes through spell immunity. How neat is that?
</li></p><li><p>This guy is the king of counterwarding with the hawk for vision and the boar for ranged attacks. If you get sentry wards, gem, or if you really want to impress everyone, a Necro 3, prepare to rob the enemy team of all their vision with your mobile dewarding crew.
</li></p><li><p>Try to aim Primal Roar like a Burrowstrike if possible. You'll only be able to stun your primary target, but any enemies caught in the line of fire will be slowed and take damage.
</li></p><li><p>Primal Roar can be used to stun couriers.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Take the time to kill the Hawk if you see it. Use a spell if you have to, the hawk isn't spell immune. Half the reason this guy gets picked is because of the vision he gives his team. If you suspect that the Hawk is already invis and you are in the mood for privacy, toss an AoE spell like Powershot or Dragon Slave on top of the nearest bunch of trees. You might inadvertently 360 noscope kill it.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="8"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/bloodseeker_full.png" alt="Bloodseeker"></span><span id=name>Bloodseeker</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Bloodrage increases <i>all</i> damage dealt from/to a hero. This means that spells and items will also deal increased damage if a hero is Bloodraged.
</li></p><li><p>You can Bloodrage allied or enemy creeps right before they die and lifesteal if you last hit them if you don't want to risk casting it on yourself.
</li></p><li><p>Enemies can't easily use Blink Dagger if they're Ruptured. It has a pretty long cast range and the debuff lasts a ridiculously long time, so it can be useful to perma-cancel a Blink from an initiator like Tidehunter or Magnus before a teamfight begins.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>TP scroll. Seriously. Just TP out if he's ganking you. He can't do anything about it.
</li></p><li><p>Kiss juking goodbye if there's a Bloodseeker on the enemy team. Once a match you'll find yourself wondering, "HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS THERE???" Then you'll look up and realize that Bloodseeker was giving his team global vision of your ass.
</li></p><li><p>In the same vein, be extremely careful when jungling against an enemy Bloodseeker. If he detects you at a dangerous HP, you can be sure that his whole team will be trying to score a kill on you.</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="9"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/bounty_hunter_full.png" alt="Bounty Hunter"></span><span id=name>Bounty Hunter</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Shadow Walk has a visible cast animation, even if you're invisible when you cast it. If your invis is about to run out and you're quietly following someone, run into the fog to recast it, otherwise the enemy hero will see a big dust cloud around you and immediately run.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Walk has a brief fade time at all levels. If you attack something during the fade time, you'll get the bonus damage without dispelling your invis.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Shadow Walk while you're channeling a TP.
</li></p><li><p>Shuriken will bounce to Tracked targets even if the initial target isn't Tracked. Try hitting a non-Tracked target first to get more total damage.
</li></p><li><p>Hover over the Track debuff icon on an enemy to see how much gold they have.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>A lot of (bad) Bounty Hunters blow Shuriken the second they start ganking you. If they do, just TP out no worries.
</li></p><li><p>Manta, Diffusal, Lotus Orb, or Guardian Greaves can all purge Track. Slark's Dark Pact can purge Track.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to your buff icons when there's a BH on the enemy team. You can't see the giant flare when it's on you, but you can see the Tracked icon in your buffs.
</li></p><li><p>Track gold adds up quickly and is what allows teams with softer carries than yours to wipe you out. Gondars LOVE trades because even though it seems like a 1:1 kill, it's more like a 1.5:1 gold kill.
</li></p><li><p>Bounty is at his strongest in the mid game when people are still separated, but still squishy, so take initiative with detection. As opposed to other invis heroes like Clinkz and Nyx, Bounty doesn't get any bonus move speed from his Shadow Walk, which makes him easy pickings if you Dust him or if he bumbles into a sentry warded area.</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="10"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/brewmaster_full.png" alt="Brewmaster"></span><span id=name>Brewmaster</span></div><div id=tips><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>I don't care what situation is, the Cyclone on the Storm Panda will always be useful. Cyclone the support so that your teammates won't waste time killing that squishy CM when they should be focusing the carry. Cyclone that dick Omniknight so his whole team cries at him for not ulting. Cyclone that PA who is slicing everyone to shreds because the rest of her team is locking your team down. Cyclone the roided up Sven and waste a whopping 6 seconds of God's Strength. Then when he comes back down, wait two seconds for it to come off cooldown and Cyclone his punk ass again.
</li></p><li><p>After you pick someone to twister, think about Dispelling some Magic. A few spells that you can Dispel include: TA's Meld, SK's invis from Sandstorm, Omniknight's Repel and Guardian Angel, the Cyclone active from Eul's, all Runes, <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel#List_of_abilities_that_can_be_removed_by_normal_dispels">and a ton of other stuff.</a>
</li></p><li><p>Casting the Storm Panda's Dispel Magic on the Cyclone will also immediately stop the Cyclone. Don't stand around watching the enemy spin for the full duration if your team is ready to kill them, just dispel it.
</li></p><li><p>The Storm Panda's Wind Walk gives you a free 100 bonus damage on the next attack. So use it! If you're quick, you should easily be able to use it twice during your ult, which is 200 physical damage that you were not using before. Late game, Wind Walk will be your main escape mechanism because your Fire Panda will go down as soon as someone so much as farts on it, and the Earth Panda goes down surprisingly quickly once carries start doling out big single target damage.
</li></p><li><p>The Wind Walk also gives a massive move speed increase on the Storm Panda. Use it if you're trying to catch an escaping enemy. Once you catch up, cast the Cyclone. The Cyclone won't end even if your ult ends.
</li></p><li><p>Many a time you'll finish your Primal Split and have the entire enemy team staring hungrily at your Earth Panda. If you have a Blink Dagger, you shouldn't worry. No matter how many times they damage your Pandas, Blink Dagger will be off cooldown the moment you reform. So just position your Earth Panda where you can get an effective Blink, and start mashing the item hotkey.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Brew is nearly impossible to kill 1v1 if you're a right clicker in the early/mid game. Between Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler, hitting this guy is a miracle. And this is if Primal Split is down.
</li></p><li><p>Pretty much every carry should consider getting an MKB or BKB early on to deal with the miss chance on Drunken Haze. Manta Style, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, and Diffusal Blade can purge the debuff as well.
</li></p><li><p>Kill the Fire Panda ASAP in the early game. This is the majority of Brewmaster's damage once he splits. Treat it like an Undying Tombstone.
</li></p><li><p>You can left click the Spirits and check their buffs to see how much time is remaining on the Split. This is relevant if you're trying to drop some damage/disables on the Earth panda before Brewmaster comes back to disable his blink.
</li></p><li><p>SILENSILSILSILESILENSILENCESILENCE. Dude hates silences and hexes. Primal Split has a cast time and Hexes and some Silences are instant. If you have these on your team he'll likely have to cut his Blink->Clap->Haze->Split combo to just Blink->Split.</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="11"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/bristleback_full.png" alt="Bristleback"></span><span id=name>Bristleback</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're against heroes with global skills (AA, Invoker, Zeus), be sure to face in the inside of your Fountain when healing to take advantage of Bristleback.
</li></p><li><p>Bristleback damage reduction does <i>not</i> work on towers.
</li></p><li><p>Spam spells to keep Warpath stacks up when roaming around the map if you have the mana regen to support it.
</li></p><li><p>Spam Quills in the fountain before TPing out to charge up Warpath stacks.
</li></p><li><p>A highly effective hero to take advantage of stacked ancients with. By the time you get a Vanguard you should be able to take a three stack of ancients literally without even looking.
</li></p><li><p>Bristle is tied for the fastest turn rate in the game. If you're laning against a ranged hero with a slow projectile, you should absolutely take advantage of this by gracefully pirouetting before every right click harass attempt.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Bristleback damage reduction is calculated based on his orientation to the hero who <a href = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11778482/HEROTIPS/herotips_files/dota%202014-11-08%2000-22-01-94.webm"><i>owns</i> the source of damage he's taking.</a> Summons deal damage based on their own position, not the hero who summoned them.
</li></p><li><p>Magic Wand is core against this guy ALL GAME LONG. Unlike other heroes who stop spamming once the laning phase ends like Batrider or Zeus, Bristle needs to mash his spells for the whole game. No matter what role you're playing, you should always get a wand or a stick.
</li></p><li><p>Quill Spray is physical damage, so if you get a Ghost Scepter this guy can't do anything except wipe his nose on you.
</li></p><li><p>Quill Spray is not reduced by damage block, so building a Crimson Guard against Bristleback won't help you as much as you'd hope.
</li></p><li><p>You can purge Goo stacks (Manta, Eul's, Diffusal, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves).
</li></p><li><p>Bristle is all about whittling down your armor and barraging you with physical damage. Stacking armor helps mitigate his damage output (Shiva's, AC, even a Basi ring is good).
</li></p><li><p>The only ways to completely shut off his passive Bristleback is with Agh Doom, Agh Shadow Demon, or Silver Edge.
</li></p><li><p>Razor makes Bristleback's life incredibly hard. Bristle can't go on Razor thanks to Unstable Current slowing him every time he casts Goo and Bristle has no easy way to stop Razor from slurping up his damage with Static Link.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="12"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/broodmother_full.png" alt="Broodmother"></span><span id=name>Broodmother</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Always be checking your enemy's items. If they're sitting around with a single sentry ward, you can be sure that they know where you are and they're waiting for the right moment to pounce.
</li></p><li><p>Always be checking your enemy's mana. If they've been blowing spells left and right to try to farm your spiders, they're leaving themselves vulnerable for an easy kill.
</li></p><li><p>You get Spiderites on Spiderling denies (or creep denies). Heck, you don't even need to get the deny, just poke every allied creep with a Spiderling and have them die within 2 seconds. Boom, free Spiderites. That's another second of sweet, sweet tower sieging.
</li></p><li><p>If an enemy is on top of your web and you want to kill them with spiders, try giving all your spiders a move/follow command on the enemy hero first. They'll seamlessly stack on the enemy and their first attack will deal a ton of damage before the enemy has a chance to react.
</li></p><li><p>In lane, time your spider harass with enemy last hits. They'll either stay still to get the last hit letting your spiders get free hits in or they'll run off and miss the last hit.
</li></p><li><p>Spiders can also be used to block or stack camps. If you're farming in the lane send some Spiders to the nearby jungle camps that you know you're going to farm or stack them.
</li></p><li><p>Spiders are also useful for cutting off creeps. Send a pile of spiders behind an enemy tower and mess with the creep equilibrium by luring them into the jungle.
</li></p><li><p>Spiderlings and Spiderites have nearly the same vision radius as a hero. If you're freefarming your legs off send a lone spider to chill somewhere up ahead to scout.
</li></p><li><p>Webs have a global cast range as long as the new one you're casting is touching an old one.
</li></p><li><p>Manta Style is a worthwhile early pickup on Brood. You can Manta out of Dust, your Illusions get Incapacitating Bite, and the move speed bonus from webs can be used by illusions (illusions don't get the free pathing, however).
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't sit around with one sentry in your inventory. Either quickly place both down or drop the extra somewhere near your tower. An ignorant Broodmother is pretty much a free kill in the early game, so don't squander your opportunity. Don't pull the ripcord too quickly or take too long. If her creep wave just died you can be sure that your creeps are going to start hitting her in her web and will completely give the jig up. Similarly, don't just throw down a sentry and then start auto attacking her wildly.
</li></p><li><p>Try to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their spiders off as soon as they see Lina float into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be making that paper.
</li></p><li><p>Get a Stout Shield to negate a lot of Spiderling/ite damage. Even as a ranged hero it can be worth it.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Double Edge costs no mana, so use it as your primary pushing spell late game. The AoE is bigger than you think and once you get a Hood of Defiance (which reduces the damage you take from Double Edge)+Heart, you should easily be able to take down a creep wave in a few seconds between Double Edge and Return.
</li></p><li><p>Return damages towers. Be a man and draw aggro from the tower to speed up the pushing process. If you want to force aggro, right click any enemy hero anywhere on the map while you're in tower range, or just be the closest target attacking the tower.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to when you can use Stampede from across the map. If your boy Shadow Fiend is getting ganked, don't be shy about turning on your lawnmower with R. Similarly, if SF is ganking Luna, but just can't keep up, use your ultimate.
</li></p><li><p>After you get Blade Mail, try to find ways to hurt yourself during its duration. KotL about to bust out an Illuminate? Gimme. Chaos Meteor rolling around? I love meatballs. Bloodseeker Rupture you for some reason? Yeeeeehaw.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Hoof Stomp has a pretty small radius. If you see a Centaur is trying to run side by side with you to ensure that he'll land it, don't keep moving straight, juke left or right.

<ul><li><p>Spread your spells out. If you land a close range stun, don't just pull the trigger on Rift. Get a few hits, wait for them to walk away for a bit, then suck back them.
</li></p><li><p>This is fairly common knowledge, but please turn on your Armlet before you Phantasm. Congratulations, you got super beefy illusions with no HP drain. This is also true pre-Manta or pre-Illusion rune for every hero.
</li></p><li><p>You can use the cast animation on Phantasm to juke projectiles.
</li></p><li><p>If you're about to die, take a risk and send one of your illusions where you wanted to go while you sit still. Most people will assume you have garbage micro and continue pursuing whichever one is moving.
</li></p><li><p>You don't really need to level Phantasm at level 6. Besides the fact that it costs nearly all your mana, you can't really get kills with it until your other spells are higher level.

<ul><li><p>Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt have amusingly long cast times. If you're getting chased by CK, use tree fog liberally to juke his spells.

<ul><li><p>If you've got nothing better to do early game as Chen, try finding a Wildwing and just send it mid. Start a Tornado and sic it on the enemy mid. Alternatively, find a Harpy and constantly cast Chain Lightning on the enemy mid. Congratulations, you just won mid lane.
</li></p><li><p>Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in the lane and try to pick up last hits, or send them to jungle/ancient camps and start stacking.
</li></p><li><p>The net on the Dark Troll Warlord goes through spell immunity and Linken's Sphere.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.
</li></p><li><p>Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, Lifestealer's Infest, and Clinkz's Death Pact are a few specific examples.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="16"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/clinkz_full.png" alt="Clinkz"></span><span id=name>Clinkz</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't just mash Strafe when it's available. The cooldown is extremely lengthy, and without it, Clinkz is pretty meh. The only time you should ever use it while farming is if you have stacked ancients.
</li></p><li><p>Searing Arrows affects structures. This + Strafe makes Clinkz a crazy good pusher.
</li></p><li><p>Similar to most other invis skills, Skeleton Walk has a very obvious cast animation (even if you cast it while invis). If you're hunting someone, run into the fog to refresh it if needed. Otherwise your target will see a puff of fire right next to them and bail.
</li></p><li><p>Try to time your ganks so that if things go wrong, Skeleton Walk is off cooldown.
</li></p><li><p>Chen/Enchantress/Dominated creeps are essentially delivery food with Death Pact. Chen creeps are especially useful since Holy Persuasion buffs their HP.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Dust is somewhat useful against Clinkz, but Sentries are much better. Clinkz gets 44% move speed bonus when he's Skelly Walkin', which makes him hard to catch with or without detection. The goal is to catch him off guard and take the offensive.
</li></p><li><p>Consider keeping your own sentries if you're a carry and Clinkz is starting to roam. You can't depend on your supports to follow you around constantly with detection.
</li></p><li><p>Get a Ghost Scepter if you're a support. It will save your life many a time.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="17"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/rattletrap_full.png" alt="Clockwerk"></span><span id=name>Clockwerk</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>When using Battery Assault in lane, position yourself so that the enemy creeps won't absorb hits. Stand along the outer perimeter of an enemy hero, rather than bulldozing through the middle of the creep wave.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid immediately right clicking the enemy hero and drawing creep aggro when you're going in with Battery Assault in lane.
</li></p><li><p>Ideally, you want to kill the corner Cogs when you're trying to break out. Enemies will occasionally shock themselves twice if they take your route out.
</li></p><li><p>Using Cogs as an area denial tool is just as useful as locking someone in. Use it to prevent enemies from chasing you or during high ground tower defenses.
</li></p><li><p>Rocket Flares give vision on detonation, we all know that, but the vision provided during the Flare's flight is just as important. Make a decision whether you want vision of a small area for a long time or a large area for a short time. If you are policing the Rosh pit, detonate the Flare there. If you're trying to get information about where the enemies are during a lull, let it fly all over their jungle and explode somewhere useless. Ideally you can do both in one flare and get a double kill where it explodes, but that's not always going to happen.
</li></p><li><p>If you're mid and wardless, use Rocket Flare to get vision of a rune spot.
</li></p><li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2flle0/thanks_to_admiral_bulldogs_urging_in_his_ama_i/">Supposedly the 'projectile' used for Rocket Flare can block jungle camps.</a> Does anyone ever use this? No. Will people harass me if I don't include this information? Yes.
</li></p><li><p>You can Hookshot to allied units or neutrals or Rosh. Keep this in mind if Hook is off cooldown and you're getting ganked.
</li></p><li><p>Hookshot stuns through spell immunity.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Battery Assault can't hit invis units but Cogs can. So if you're playing Sand King and you think you're safe in your Sandstorm, be aware that the shock on Cogs can hit you.
</li></p><li><p>Rattletrap: Professional Clarity Assassin. Try to keep clarity/salve usage on the down low, even if Clock's not in your lane. That dude will Flare you at the worst possible times.
</li></p><li><p>Rocket Flare is a popular spell to get cross-map kills. If you're low on HP and Clock is far away, pause for a moment once you're in fog to try to evade a flare.
</li></p><li><p>Hookshots are fairly easy to juke if you know they're coming. If you're trying to escape and you just walked into a flare, stand still for a moment or change your current path trajectory.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Frostbite lasts for 10 seconds on creeps and will do 70 DPS at all levels (WOW THAT'S LIKE 700 DAMAGE). This allows you to grab some easy XP or ward money from a large neutral camp as one Frostbite+some auto attacks will usually be enough to kill the biggest creep in the camp. Just do your team a favor and try to finish the whole camp though. No one wants your leftovers.
</li></p><li><p>If you're going Battle Maiden, one item of choice is Shadow Blade/Shadow Amulet since you can cast the invis while you're channeling your ult.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't underestimate her early game damage. If you don't have any stuns/silences, her ult will destroy you in a 1v1 support cage match.
</li></p><li><p>Frostbite will disable blinking spells (and obviously Blink Dagger). If you're an AM or QoP and CM is sauntering towards you, you can be sure that she has backup.
</li></p><li><p>In matches against CM, you'll often find yourself wondering, <i>"How does X have so much mana!?"</i> CM is why they have so much mana. So don't assume that just because AA has Chilled his Touch 3 times at level 2 that he's going to stop any time soon.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="19"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/dark_seer_full.png" alt="Dark Seer"></span><span id=name>Dark&nbsp;Seer</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Vacuum destroys trees in a small AoE. Use this against enemies who like blinking/hiding in the trees.
</li></p><li><p>When the two creep waves meet during the laning phase, watch for which of the enemy melee creeps is taking the least damage and then Ion Shell that one. Now the enemies can't kill the Shelled creep on demand.
</li></p><li><p>For some reason you can cast Ion Shell on enemy heroes. The main use for this would be casting it on enemy melee heroes during tower defenses They'll either kill their whole creep wave or they'll have to back off attacking the tower.
</li></p><li><p>Don't put Ion Shells on frontline creeps. You want to put it on the 2nd/3rd creep in the wave whenever you're pushing or farming. The first creep in the wave is going to take the most damage from the enemy wave and will die first.
</li></p><li><p>Ion Shelling invisible allies is hilarious. The damage isn't large enough to show a huge white bar of missing HP building up on an unsuspecting enemy and the purple lines emitting from the shell don't even appear.
</li></p><li><p>75% of the time, your allies will benefit from a Surge more than you can. Don't be a scrooge. Surge and Shell that Radiance+Scorched Earth Doom and watch him turn into a 522 MS Epicenter. Help Crystal Maiden put that ward down without being molested for once. Let Batrider take someone halfway across the map in three seconds.
</li></p><li><p>You can Surge the courier.
</li></p><li><p>A Wall of Replica across the top of the stairs on a tier 3 tower can instantly discourage a push. I know it feels bad that you won't be able to make copies if the enemy decide to not push, but if you know that you're not going to get good positioning or a good Vacuum, it can be worth it.
</li></p><li><p>Micro the illusions generated by Wall of Replica. I don't know what their default command is when they're created, but I'm guessing it's something along the lines of: "Attack useless things." As soon as you score a good Vacuum+Wall, order all the units to attack the highest priority target on the enemy team.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If Seer is solo versus two of you, the support should just sit on his side of the lane very early on. The more you can zone him out early, the better since once he gets a few levels into Ion Shell you won't be able to trade hits with him. Wait for him to Shell a creep, then immediately pop out and start poking his pointy butt.
</li></p><li><p>When trying to kill Seer, try to save stuns and disables for AFTER he casts Surge.
</li></p><li><p>You can purge Surge. This includes purges from Diffusal Blade or purges from Cyclones (Eul's or Invoker's).
</li></p><li><p>Every time the Wall makes an illusion of you, you'll take the nuke damage from the Wall again. So stop standing in the wall to kill them, you round headed schmuck.
</li></p><li><p>If you're a carry, pay attention to when an illusion is made of you. While you're critting their team for buckets o' damage, your Bizarro counterpart is doing the same to your supports. Do your team a favor and kill your illusion before it zones them out.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="20"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/dazzle_full.png" alt="Dazzle"></span><span id=name>Dazzle</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p> Many players don't notice that Dazzle's claim to fame is that all of his spells revolve around physical damage. Poison Touch ticks physically, Shadow Wave heals and deals damage physically, and Weave is all about mitigating armor value. SUCH SYNERGY.
</li></p><li><p>Be smart about using heals post-Shallow Grave. I'm fine if you Grave someone at 50% HP, because at least you're trying. Just don't waste heals on a 1HP Shallow Graved ally when there are 4 seconds left on the Grave clock. Wait for the ring around them to drop to the ground (when it does, time's up) and then immediately Mek+Shadow Wave them and watch the enemies freak out. You're wasting precious healing potential by healing someone who's safe and is going to get that HP burned off inevitably anyway.
</li></p><li><p>For some reason you can Shallow Grave illusions. Mind game potential too strong.
</li></p><li><p>Shallow Grave to an immediate TP can get you out of nearly every gank situation early game unless you're against some sort of Mirana, Rhasta, Lion lane.
</li></p><li><p>Dazzle has a instance of damage around himself when Shadow Wave is cast. When pushing, stand in the middle of enemy creeps to take advantage of this.
</li></p><li><p>What's that Omniknight? You can't heal spell immune allies? Dazzle badger don't care about no BKB. You can Shadow Wave or Weave any BKB'd ally or enemy. Even if the enemy activates a BKB post-Weave it won't get purged. Dazzle badger don't care.
</li></p><li><p>Weave priority list goes as follows: During pushes, whichever team is pushing gets the Weave. Tower shots hurt like hell or don't even scratch depending on your armor values. In team fights, Weave as soon as possible on as much as possible. If your team has more physical damage, Weave the enemies and vice versa.
</li></p><li><p>Weave is a useful scouting tool. Use it to check the Rosh pit from afar or scout high ground. The vision radius is huge, the cast range is very generous, and the cooldown is low enough that it's usually okay to 'waste' it.</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't aimlessly walk into a wave of enemy creeps if you're going for a kill on Dazzle. One Shadow Wave will quickly tear you apart, especially if you have low armor.
</li></p>
<li><p>Ancient Apparition makes life hard for Dazzle (and other healers) with Ice Blast. Ice Blast won't kill/shatter someone who's Graved, but Dazzle can't heal them up to protect them.</li></p>
</li></p><li><p>Culling Blade kills through Shallow Grave.
</li></p><li><p>Shallow Grave ends when the ring falling around the hero touches the ground.
</li></p><li><p>Eul's can potentially be used to kill 1HP Shallow Graved targets.
</li></p><li><p>Weave keeps adding up over time. Just because you're doing fine in the first few seconds of a team fight doesn't mean you'll hold up as well when you're at -5 armor. Make team fights snappy when fighting against a Dazzle.</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Krobe will walk to wherever you cast Crypt Swarm if it's not within 600 range even though she can hit units 1100 range away. Keep this in mind during chases or pushes.
</li></p><li><p>Crypt Swarm can use unit targeting or ground targeting. If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground targeting, otherwise Death Prophet may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.
</li></p><li><p>Exorcism ghosts deal physical damage. As a result, it goes through BKB, does more/less damage based on armor values and is generally relevant all game long.
</li></p><li><p>Your Ghosts will target whoever you right click. You can change targets even if you're disabled/stunned/Chronosphered/Cycloned.
</li></p><li><p>When pushing undefended towers, stand closer to the tower. This will decrease the amount of time your ghosts spend circling back to you after hitting the structure and allow you to deal more damage.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Chasing her down mid-Exorcism is a dangerous game. Besides the fact that the ghosts do a lot of damage, it's entirely likely that the ghosts will completely fill up her HP once they're done and she'll just turn around and destroy you.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="22"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/disruptor_full.png" alt="Disruptor"></span><span id=name>Disruptor</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Count down your Glimpses. Glimpse is an incredibly powerful spell, but only if used intelligently. Glimpse will always revert someone to where they were 4 seconds prior. So as soon as you see someone out of position, remember where they were and start counting to four. Watch where the end location dot is and cast a field around it.
</li></p><li><p>One method to timing Glimpses is by casting a Thunder Strike on your target and then waiting for the third strike to trigger (the third Thunder Strike shock will occur 4.5 seconds after the initial cast). Plus Thunder Strike gives you vision of your target.
</li></p><li><p>Glimpse will break any channels. You don't need to time the Glimpse so seamlessly that the travel time of the ball will trigger while they're TPing, just Glimpse them as soon as you see them.
</li></p><li><p>Kinetic Field provides vision inside the circle, allowing you to scout Rosh, trees, or high ground from long range.
</li></p><li><p>The outside of Kinetic Field is just as useful as the inside. Don't be afraid to block someone on the outside with the edge rather than lock them in.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>TP behind trees or even one tier back if you're defending a push against Disruptor unless you like wasting 100 gold. Glimpse will also be a real pain if you're a Nature's Prophet, Wisp, Spectre, or Tinker.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to the AoE of the Static Storm. Many a time a Disruptor will cast half of it within the Kinetic Field and the other half outside. Stop running against the wall of the Field and sitting in the Storm if you don't have to.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Learn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which ones best match your playstyle. Get a Kobold from an easy camp early game for the move speed, Centaur from a medium camp mid game for the Stomp, and an Alpha Wolf from a medium camp late game for the crits and aura. If you're jungling, try to get the big red Satyr for the HP regen or the blue Ogre for the Ice Armor. If you're stacking camps, get the Wildwing and take down the stack with the Tornado.
</li></p><li><p>The net on the Dark Troll Warlord goes through spell immunity and Linken's Sphere.
</li></p><li><p>LVL? Death always comes with a ministun on cast. You don't need to waste Doom to stop a channel.
</li></p><li><p><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> mutes usage of items. Besides stopping someone from TPing, it's also useful against Mek or Pipe carriers.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Pay attention to what creep ability Doom has by clicking on him. Don't get surprised when his team rushes out of nowhere because he has the Kobold aura or if he breaks your channel after LVL? Death because he took a Centaur Stomp.
</li></p><li><p>Please deny your allies when they're Doomed. I'm not walking near you because I want to tell my wife I love her, I need you to kill me.
</li></p><li><p>However, you ideally want to click on your ally and track how much time is left on the Doom debuff icon because deny range != dead range.
</li></p><li><p><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> mutes items, including that Magic Wand that I know you want to use so badly because it should be enough to just barely sav... you're dead.

<ul><li><p>Breathe Fire hits siege creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Dragon Form's passive attack (Corrosive Breath) works on towers. This is what makes DK such a mean pusher early on.
</li></p><li><p>The transformation into Dragon Form is nearly as useful as the Dragon Form itself during the laning phase. No one ever expects you to suddenly go full Dragon and whip out a 450 range 2.5 second stun in the span of no seconds. People know how far to stand away from a DK in Knight form and people know to stand much further back from a DK in Dragon form. Don't give them the chance to adapt.
</li></p><li><p><i>STACK ANCIENTS!</i> Use a dominated creep to stack and then use your ult to take them down.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>In higher level games, keep watch on DK's ancients. Block them or kill his dominated creep if you're in the area. If you win a team fight and he's been stacking, hijack his stack with your team.

<ul><li><p>Drow not only has stupid long attack range, but she also has an orb effect. Abuse this in lane. If you're not able to get last hits because her animation blows, at least make life annoying for whoever is in your lane.
</li></p><li><p>Don't forget to turn off Frost Arrows if you have Lifesteal. The orbs don't stack.
</li></p><li><p>The knockback on Gust doesn't break channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.
</li></p><li><p>However, the knockback does move enemies, making it cancel Templar Assassin's Meld and Shadow Amulet.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Get in her face. Even if you're eating tons of damage, there is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. Besides losing half of her ult damage, you can usually scare Drows if you manmode on them.

<ul><li><p>You can drop a Remnant right in front of your Boulder while you're revving up.
</li></p><li><p>You can use items while Rolling (except Blink). This is mainly useful for TPs, Shiva's, Sheepstick/Orchid, and wards. If you use a Force Staff while it's revving up, you'll get the Force and continue rolling. If you use Force while rolling, you'll get the Force but the Boulder will break apart.
</li></p><li><p>You can pick up runes while Rolling.
</li></p><li><p>You can use/target spells while you're in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.
</li></p><li><p>When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately kick them back along the path you came.
</li></p><li><p>Rolling Boulder destroys trees along the path that you roll.
</li></p><li><p>Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels.
</li></p><li><p>Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.
</li></p><li><p>The trickiest part about using Magnetize effectively is getting it started. The initial Magnetize radius is a tiny AoE around Earth Spirit himself. But once you get it cracking on one unit, then the good times can start to roll. Use Force Staff or Boulder Smash to manipulate the Magnetized unit's position to get closer to other heroes, then cast a Remnant near it.
</li></p><li><p>The trigger radius on a Remnant from a magnetized unit is larger than the activation/refresh radius to Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to un-Magnetized enemies.
</li></p><li><p>The Magnetize DoT lasts for 6 seconds on an enemy. Space out re-Magnetizations to squeeze out the most damage.
</li></p><li><p>Rolling into an Enchant Remnant (Agh skill) will immediately take the hero out of Remnant form.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Kaolin Showdown isn't invulnerable inside the Rolling Boulder. He's fully targeted and can be stunned and damaged as per usual.
</li></p><li><p>Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and they're not.

<ul><li><p>In most situations, the block on Fissure is more valuable than the stun itself. So if you're trying to throw out a Fissure from long range, lead it ahead more than you want to. If you don't land the stun, it's a minor inconvenience. Separating your team from your target, that's a major inconvenience.
</li></p><li><p>If you're trying to milk your stun time for as long as possible, don’t mash all your spells at once. You can squeeze in about one auto-attack's worth of time in between casts once Aftershock is maxed. Alternatively, you can shift+queue your Fissure and Enchant Totem. This'll make Earthshaker wait for his full 0.5s backswing animation before casting the next spell.
</li></p><li><p>If you feel a fight coming on, prime up an Enchant Totem if you have the mana to spare. The duration is 14 seconds long, so you should be able to walk in with one Enchanted Totem and pull out another one during the fight.
</li></p></ul>

<ul><li><p>ES has basically no mana early game, so you'll often see him sucking down clarities pretty frequently in lane. More often than not it can be worth using a spell or tanking some creeps to take it off of him.

<ul><li><p>Tower shots or creep attacks won't wake enemies up from Echo Stomp.
</li></p><li><p>Don't start whaling on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get into a better position, then go to town.
</li></p><li><p>Cast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. I don't understand why so few ET players take advantage of this. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns at 600 move speed, players won't always react quick enough to dodge it.
</li></p><li><p>The Spirit walks around as fast as ET at the time of casting. This means that a Surged ET will have a Surge-speed Spirit. Active Phase Boots won't speed the Spirit up though.
</li></p><li><p>Having your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.
</li></p><li><p>You can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. Spirit starts cooling down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned. When the Spirit comes back from its semester abroad, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage and you'll have another Spirit ready in the chamber to finish them off.
</li></p><li><p>Use the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.
</li></p><li><p>During chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run through the whole thing and risk getting slept or they have to change paths.
</li></p><li><p>You can teleport to the Spirit using Boots of Travel.
</li></p><li><p>You can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow the target for its duration.
</li></p><li><p>Ideally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>With shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be dealing to you.
</li></p><li><p>Similarly, Force Staff gives you an easy eject button if you're getting comboed into some of his spells.

<div id="29"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/ember_spirit_full.png" alt="Ember Spirit"></span><span id=name>Ember Spirit</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>The capture radius on Searing Chains is huge, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than <s>complaining about</s> relying on RNG.
</li></p><li><p>While Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage or stun.
</li></p><li><p>You can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight remnant.
</li></p><li><p>You can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when chasing and activating them at the tail end of a Sleight will make you extremely difficult to lock down when being chased.
</li></p><li><p>The hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chain combo is knowing when Sleight will actually go off. Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.
</li></p><li><p>When manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto attacks.
</li></p><li><p>Your Remnants travel at 2.5x your move speed when cast. This means that you should avoid casting fresh Remnants if you're trying to escape when you're slowed.
</li></p><li><p>This also applies to weird 'leash' spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Slark's Pounce. If you walk to the very limit of the leash then your move speed is considered zero and your Remnant won't go anywhere.
</li></p><li><p>You can pick up items (such as Aegis) or runes while traveling to a Remnant.
</li></p><li><p>The explosion damage radius of an activated Remnant is actually larger than the Searing Chains capture radius. If you're about to gank someone, cast a Remnant to the side of them that has the fewest enemy units, rather than directly on top of them.
</li></p><li><p>Remnants give a small amount of basic vision. They're no Beastmaster Hawks, but they can be useful when trying to get vision inside the Rosh pit.
</li></p><li><p>Use Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map as soon as you respawn (or buyback).
</li></p><li><p>Remnants have a 45 seconds duration but a 35 second recharge time. This means that you have a 10 second window to use 4 Remnants in a gank if you have one pre-casted. This is mainly useful for mid lane matchups.
</li></p><li><p>I highly recommend using the
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">dota_disable_range_finder 0</font>
<br><br>
console command when playing Ember. It becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off and you'll be able to exploit the full Remnant cast range during ganks and escapes.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Whenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up stuns like Mirana's Arrow or Jakiro's Ice Path or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can catch him as soon as he returns.
</li></p><li><p>Ember hates silences, but he also really hates slows. The travel speed on Remnant casts scale off of Ember's own move speed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.
</li></p><li><p>Ember consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he activates one. If an Ember just Remnant'd in on a teammate, it can be worth following up and chasing to force him to cast an escape Remnant.
</li></p><li><p>Sleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.
</li></p><li><p>You can purge off Flame Guard. This makes Eul's a solid item to have against Ember.

<ul><li><p>Untouchable is a highly underrated skill. This makes you a real dick to trade hits with if you do choose to lane with her. It also makes you a great hero to tank Rosh since he attacks in bullet time.
</li></p><li><p>You can Enchant nearly every enemy/neutral units. Necronomicon creeps and enemy illusions are both A+++ steals.
</li></p><li><p>You can re-cast Enchant on a controlled unit to refresh the duration.
</li></p><li><p>Impetus calculates the damage by the distance between you and the target once the projectile hits the target. Thus, after tossing an Imp, you can run back or Force Staff to get some more damage while it travels. Unfortunately, there's a cap at 2500 distance, so don't get a Blink Dagger… Although… that does sound intriguing.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're a right clicker, try to let your supports take care of Bambi. You'll be wasting your time trying to kill her mid game when nukes will touch her Untouchable fluffy tail quicker than you can.

<ul><li><p>Be a bro and convert one of the mid lane's creeps at 0:00. You still have enough time to go back to the fountain and make it to the jungle without losing too much time.
</li></p><li><p>You can make Eidolons out of Eidolons, thus further Horcruxing it. The cooldown for Conversion gives you about ~0.5s to quickly convert an Eidolon before it disappears. This information is highly relevant during Rosh attempts.
</li></p><li><p>Jungle creeps have a tendency to use their spells whenever three units are in close proximity to them. If you just converted something, chances are your Eidolons will eat the damage, but if you're moving to a new camp with old Eidolons, spread them out so they don't trigger a spell.
</li></p><li><p>When jungling, be aware that you can drop neutral aggro off of your Eidolons the same way you can drop tower aggro. Select the Eidolon in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should lose interest in that Eidolon.
</li></p><li><p>I don't know why you can convert siege creeps into three Eniglets, but you can. This can speed up certain pushes significantly.
</li></p><li><p>Midnight Pulse breaks trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees during a chase, or to be super sneaky and carve a path to hide so you can easily blink in for huge Black Holes.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Blink Dagger is a big deal on Enigma, especially if he's a team's sole initiator. If you can get a DoT or some damage on Enigma and then quickly initiate on their team, you can be sure that he will be furiously clicking his Blink Dagger but won't be able to do anything.
</li></p><li><p>"Hey guys don’t clump, I think Black Hole is off coo… GOD DAMN IT."
</li></p><li><p>Beastmaster is a solid pick against Enigma since he can stand on the other end of a Black Hole and still stun him out of BKB with Primal Roar. Vengeful Spirit is also a good pick since Nether Swap also penetrates spell immunity.

<ul><li><p>You're invulnerable when using Time Walk. While not always practical, you can use this to run head first into projectiles like Wraith King's stun or KotL's ponies and then just start whaling on them.
</li></p><li><p>Chronosphere reveals invisible units. If Prophet decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out, cast a Chrono along the path and laugh maniacally when you discover him without any sort of detection.
</li></p><li><p>Donkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will not freeze the enemy courier.
</li></p><li><p>Any units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere. This makes Necrobook or Manta Void viable builds for more deeps in your Chrono.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Eul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. Voids rarely go BKB so as long as you're not caught in a Chrono, you should be able to waste a good 2.5s of Chrono time by Cycloning him. Plus, it'll purge off Mask of Madness's active.
</li></p><li><p>MKB doesn't counter Backtrack and BKB doesn't counter Time Lock. What I'm saying is, you better end the game fast because Void don't care what items you built.
</li></p><li><p>Void can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to be tricky in Ability Draft.

<ul><li><p>Rocket Barrage is incredibly deadly at early levels. Spend time roaming around in the jungle if you can to catch out unsuspecting junglers or supports.
</li></p><li><p>Rocket Barrage hits siege creeps.
</li></p><li><p>You can use Force Staff on the Homing Missile for some reason.
</li></p><li><p>Stack ancients if you're carrying with Gyro. Flak Cannon will hit every single unit in the AoE for the same damage. The spell is basically built to exploit stacking.
</li></p><li><p>Flak Cannon hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit the tower if you're attacking creeps.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Taking on Gyrocopter 1v1 in the early or mid game is probably suicidal. A level 4 Rocket Barrage will deal 690 magic damage to you if you eat all of it. Get a huddle going with your creeps if Gyro is trying to make a move on you.
</li></p><li><p>If you're at low HP, it can be smarter to eat the rocket early than gamble that your tower will be able to kill it before it reaches Spirit Breaking speeds.
</li></p><li><p>Creeps can't kill the rocket. While they draw aggro from it, only tower shots or hero attacks can damage it.
</li></p><li><p>Ward this guy's ancients or just pop in real quick and kill his dominated creep. Or even better yet, win a team fight and then take his stacks.

<ul><li><p>Inner Vitality can be cast on allies and has a fairly low cooldown for the amount that it heals. Cast it on your friendly neighborhood support after a team fight to make their life much easier. Or if you're falling behind in a game and are no longer the primary damage dealer, cast it on your team's carry.
</li></p><li><p>It can be difficult to get yourself to low HPs on demand, especially once you get lifesteal. Life Break creeps to burn off HP if necessary.
</li></p><li><p>Turn on your Armlet AFTER you Life Break, not before.
</li></p><li><p>On the other hand turn on your BKB BEFORE you Life Break so as to not take the self-damage (works with Omni Repel as well).
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>You really need some form of pure damage or solid physical damage if you're planning on dealing with Huskar. Berserker's Blood gives him stupid high levels of magic resistance. Timbersaw is probably the ideal counter. Other good heroes would be OD, Silencer, Tinker, Bane. Blade Mail also deals pure damage.

<ul><li><p>Remember to change your orbs for their passive uses during the game. I know it's difficult to keep track and a lot of Invokers like to have their next spell Pre-Voked, but those 3 Wex orbs can make the difference between you catching up to an enemy or not. Or those 3 Quas orbs early on could save your life mid.
</li></p><li><p>Remember your stunning spells: Cold Snap, Deafening Blast, and technically Tornado. If you don't know what to cast and Invoke is off cool down, just use one of these (if you're leveling them accordingly, that is. Don't be tossing around Tornadoes with 1 Wex).
</li></p><li><p>Cold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel Bottle charges on the enemy mid from a distance if you have vision of them.
</li></p><li><p>Urn of Shadows can trigger a Cold Snap every ~0.5s.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of destroying your teammates plans.
</li></p><li><p>Tornado has a purging effect that can take off runes or certain buffs, like Meld.
</li></p><li><p>I remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the <b>WWE Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</b> 
</li></p><li><p>Alacrity can be cast on siege creeps. Tether+Overcharge and Bloodlust them as well for huge hyperexcited catapults.
</li></p><li><p>Forge Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.
</li></p><li><p>Forge Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Spawn a Forge Spirit around 20 seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.
</li></p><li><p>Ghost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to QQ... W.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke while you're channeling though, because that'll cancel it.
</li></p><li><p>Don't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally, you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a gank situation.
</li></p><li><p>Ice Wall is actually ridiculous in the mid lane matchup. With 3 points in Quas it's a 60% slow. If someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.
</li></p><li><p>With practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies. It's effectively a 650 range slow if you can aim it right.
</li></p><li><p>Learn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike, Ice Wall+Being the greatest spell in Voker's arsenal that is criminally underused.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Always keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.
</li></p><li><p>Try to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game, rather than after.
</li></p><li><p>Forge Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to be a dick. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for whatever is about to happen next.

<ul><li><p>Since Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to pre-emptively disable enemies. This is good against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are Tornado'd, or heroes who are TP'ing in who like to immediately blink after.
</li></p><li><p>Liquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and is what makes Jakiro a great pusher. Pay attention to when it's off cool down and use it accordingly. This also makes Jakiro a good buddy to have during tower dives and solo Rosh attempts.
</li></p><li><p>Try to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.
</li></p><li><p>No one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. It's not a big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage engagements. Either that or they'll be all, "Guys, Macropyre is down, let's get this Magnus, Enigma, Gyro, Void, DS combo started."
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Ice Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it.
</li></p><li><p>When Liquid Fire is off cooldown, the fire head starts glowing and dripping fire. Jakiro will use the fire head for all attacks until Liquid Fire is used.

<ul><li><p>Common knowledge, but you can TP when you're in Blade Fury. Use this to farm to your heart's content with little fear of being ganked.
</li></p><li><p>The mechanics behind right clicking during Blade Fury: Does it deal damage to heroes? No. Does it deal damage to towers? Yes. Does it apply/refresh orb effects like Orb of Venom? Yes.
</li></p><li><p>You can Blade Fury into a Black Hole or Chronosphere without it getting canceled.
</li></p><li><p>Rather than frantically clicking around an enemy while attempting to Blade Fury them, use a follow command (default M+left click) on the target hero. This makes you impossible to juke and takes the guesswork out of following the enemy.
</li></p><li><p>Jughead is a competent solo pusher with staying power that the Healing Ward gives creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Healing Ward gives a fair amount of vision (500/500) and moves pretty fast this makes it a clever tool for scouting if you don't need the heal. Use it to scout Rosh or check uphill for you.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast spells (except Blade Fury) and use items while mid-Omnislash (except TPs).
</li></p><li><p>If you're 6, constantly be looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to create one is to quickly kill the enemy's creep wave and then pounce on him while he's wondering why you got four last hits and he has yet to get one. The lane push will be worth the kill.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If he's 6, he's constantly looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to avoid getting owned is to always stay next to your creeps and to always be a mile away from your wave when it dies.
</li></p><li><p>Going Ethereal (from Ghost Scepter, Ethereal Blade, or Pugna's Decrepify) protects you from damage received during Omnislash. If you're the only target to Omnislash, it'll stop his ult completely. Eul's can also be used to evade Omni damage, but he'll keep slashing at the Tornado and will continue after you come down.
</li></p><li><p>Keep tabs on Jugg's mana in lane. Blade Fury is a free kill in most lanes as long as Jugg has the mana to cast it. If he doesn't, he's practically harmless.
</li></p><li><p>HOLY PEACHES, PLEASE KILL THE HEALING WARD. It takes 1 attack. Doesn't matter if it's a 1k crit from Drow or a love tap from a 10 damage Visage Familiar, KILL IT.

<ul><li><p>Stop channeling Illuminate in the middle of the lane. Keeper works best as a creepy old hero molester hiding in the trees gently stroking his staff, waiting to explode.
</li></p><li><p>Don't be afraid to terminate an Illuminate early if people are moving away. The horses have a travel time and a small amount of assured damage can sometimes be better than a huge amount of unreliable damage.
</li></p><li><p>Learn where the creeps should be according to what the time is to get the most out of Illuminate. The easiest way to do this is to look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where those creeps are.
</li></p><li><p>Don't be channeling an Illuminate at X:53 when pushing into T3s just because it's off cooldown, start it at X:57.
</li></p><li><p>Your Illuminate range damage is longer than experience range. You can use this to help a lane mate get XP even faster during pushes, but it can also hurt you if you're freefarming and losing out on XP. This is mainly relevant if you're jungling and trying to Illuminate 2 camps at once.
</li></p><li><p>If you're trying to maximize your Chakra usage, try to get as little INT on a hero before you Chakra them. Change your Treads or put your Sheep or Bloodstone on the ground. It's the same concept as shedding STR before you heal, yet used much less frequently. Though I'd draw the line at dropping branches unless you're aui_2000.
</li></p><li><p>When trying to Recall a teammate in danger, keep in mind that if they receive any damage from a hero, the Recall gets canceled. Wait for your ally to run into the trees or just escape fog to initiate the Recall, then just cross your fingers that they can keep juking.
</li></p><li><p>If you're priming up a push with your team, let your carry farm another lane and then Recall them in.
</li></p><li><p>Blinding Light won't stop channels even though it bounces enemies. You can use it if it makes you feel better, but Tinker is still going to TP out before you can kill him.
</li></p><li><p>When escaping a gank in Spirit Form, cast Blinding Light in front of you, instead of behind. Keeper will turn around to cast it if you target it behind you, which pretty much kills whatever gap you were creating with the bounce.

<ul><li><p>The outrageously long cast animation on Split Earth is both a blessing and a curse. It's mainly a curse, but you can use it to your advantage. In lane, there are few things more irritating than seeing a Leshrac go all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps#mediaviewer/File:Napoleon4.jpg">Napoleon Crossing the Alps,</a> moving so you don't get stunned, and then him canceling the animation. You can also use the cast animation to stun people chasing you without having to turn around by casting it directly in front of your feet.
</li></p><li><p>When munching on a tower with Edict, become a zen master of positioning. Leshrac is one of the few heroes who can successfully push towers even while your creep wave changes aggro from the tower to the next enemy creep wave. Just stand in the corner of the AoE so that you're only seeing explosions underneath the tower and give her the edict. If you don't right click, you won't draw any aggro and the tower will continue attacking whichever unit is closest, which will still be the creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Try to bait out a glyph when you walk up to a tower before using Edict. Edict has a cast time, so try to cancel it during your T-pose. Most of the time people will just glyph the second they see Leshrac smugly standing alone by their tower, but it's still worth a shot.
</li></p><li><p>Edict can hit invisible units. Try chasing down invis enemies if you think they'll be traveling a predictable path.
</li></p><li><p>Eul's is an amazing item on Leshrac. If you're having a bad game and you know you're not going to be able to hold on to Bloodstone charges, consider getting a Eul's. If you're having a good game, still consider getting Eul's. Not only does it give amazing mana regen for the price, but it gives move speed and has one of the best synergy actives with Leshrac in the game. First of all Cyclone has no cast time and has pretty generous range, so when you're hunting someone down, just Cyclone them and then start priming a Split Earth. Secondly, Edict and Pulse Nova continue doling out damage around you even when you're Cycloned, so just run into the middle of the fight and start raving in the air for a free 2.5 seconds of uninterrupted Pulse Nova'ing.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Split Earth is one of the easiest stuns in the game to juke. It has an incredibly obvious cast animation and has an eternity of a cast time. It is usually worth running backwards a small distance just to dodge it.
</li></p><li><p>There's nothing a Leshrac hates more than ganking someone near creeps. It can be worth it to stand with your creep wave rather than trying to retreat if you're getting ganked by Leshrac with Edict turned on. You'd be surprised how little damage Edict does when it's diffused among 6 units.
</li></p><li><p>Don't glyph your structures until you see Leshrac turn on his Edict if he's pushing your towers.

<ul><li><p>Sacrifice is always the first thing you level and you should immediately eat a melee creep (more XP given than a ranged creep) at 0:00. Ideally you should eat it from mid lane if you trust your mid.
</li></p><li><p>Position your Sacrifices so that the enemy players aren't in experience range of the creep when you eat it. Every hero in XP range will receive experience from a Sacrificed creep, so cast it behind towers, rather than once the creeps meet in lane.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Ice Armor on creeps. If you're trying to help out on a push, start slapping Ice Armor on all your frontline creeps to slow the enemy's melee creeps and buff up your own.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Ice Armor on towers and buildings. Everyone forgets this, like holy crap.
</li></p><li><p>Chain Frost has a ministun on the very first target it hits. If you see Sand King headbanging, it can be worth using your Chain Frost on him to stop his channel. Similarly, it can be worth using Chain Frost on an enemy BKB'd carry that's trying to TP out of an ill-fated farming adventure since the stun goes through BKB. Don't worry about the slow projectile speed, the stun is triggered as soon as you cast, not when it hits.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>You're losing out on a <i>lot</i> of experience per wave if you're laning against Lich. The enemies will likely hit 6 significantly before you do, so beware of aggression.

<ul><li><p>You can TP while Raged. If you're TPing back to base and you have at least 150 mana (75 for Rage, 75 for the TP) there are very few situations in which you shouldn't use this.
</li></p><li><p>So you got caught out and now you're being slowly escorted down the lane by five enemy heroes while you're meditating inside one of their ranged creeps (always Infest the enemy ranged creep when in this situation, it'll take the longest time to die naturally). Use the aforementioned tip. Wait for Rage to come off cooldown, pop it the second you bust out, and try to TP.
</li></p><li><p>Controlling a creep while infested won't break the creep's cover. This means that enemies won't be able to kill one of their own summons/creeps even when you start walking it back to your fountain.
</li></p><li><p>Learn how to choke-point jungle if you're going to jungle with him. Naix is one of the best to do it with.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid initiating team fights with Open Wounds. This skill is your free Satanic. When you're about to die, crack Pudge open like a coconut and drink his blood. The slow is useful in 1v1 or gank situations, but the massive lifesteal is invaluable in team fights.
</li></p><li><p>Midasing a creep that has Open Wounds on it will heal you.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>OH MASTA, LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPPORTS KITING ME. Ghost Scepter, Force Staff, Blink Dagger and Shiva's Guard are all great pickups against a Naix. As is a TP scroll if he hasn't gotten a Basher yet.
</li></p><li><p>If you have a lot of HP, stay away from him. Lifestealer likes killing people, but he also like stealing life. He'll gladly get kited by Luna if it means that he can paw at the nearby Centaur Warrunner a few times to get up to half HP.
</li></p><li><p>You want to strongly avoid building a Heart against a Naix for the same reason. Feast will deal more damage to you and heal him more if you have a lot of HP.
</li></p><li><p>It's okay to stack stuns on Naix, mainly because Rage has no cast time. As a result, he'll probably be able to get out of most situations unless you're secretly a bot.
</li></p><li><p>Every initiator becomes twice as fearsome when Naix is on the enemy team. Storm Spirit, Clockwerk, Batrider, Wisp, Nature's Prophet, etc, are all Mk. IV Naix Bombers. Even other units like the Spirit Bear, Beastmaster Hawk, Brood Spiders, Lycan Wolves, etc, all become things to fear.

<ul><li><p>While Lina has a terrible auto-attack animation, she also has ludicrous range to compensate. Few heroes can trade hits with you, despite your pizza spinning auto attack.
</li></p><li><p>It's okay to blow a few spells to keep Fiery Soul stacks up. Once you have a high enough mana regen, you can keep yourself at Sanic speeds by alternating between Dragon Slave and LSA. Build up stacks in the fountain before a TP or use spells on nothing to speed up an escape.
</li></p><li><p>Laguna Blade has a stupid short cooldown for how effective it is at 6. Abuse it.
</li></p><li><p>An Agh upgraded Laguna can target and kill couriers.

<ul><li><p>Be aware of the advantages of ground targeting Earth Spike. The cast range is about 300 units shorter than the actual range of the stun. Ground targeting also makes it possible to thread the needle between heroes, allowing you to potentially get a stun on multiple targets.
</li></p><li><p>That being said, stop ground targeting Earth Spike when you don't have to. Icefrog's such a nice guy, he gives you a mostly guaranteed targeting system for free. There is a special circle in hell for Lions who skillshot and whiff Earth Spike on single targets.
</li></p><li><p>If you a feel a team fight coming on, keep casting and canceling Hex on their initiator. Hexes have 0 cast time and the second your target comes into range (like with a Blink Dagger), the spell will get cast. If you're worried about Magnus RPing your team, group up all juicy-like, bait his blink, then Frogitize him, Cap'n.
</li></p><li><p>Hex and Mana Drain are simple spells that quickly kill Illusions. Early game this isn't really relevant, but when Naga or Spectre start getting fat, this can be useful.
</li></p><li><p>Common knowledge, but you can Mana Drain enemy ranged creeps and many jungle creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Time your Mana Drains on enemy heroes in lane with last hits. If one of your creeps is about to die, start Draining. Either they go for the last hit and lose a bunch of mana, or immediately back off and lose the last hit.
</li></p><li><p>Mana Drain is a cheap and long range way to break Linken's Sphere.
</li></p><li><p>At level 6, Finger of Death deals 450 damage to a hero with normal magic resistance and no additional magic resistance items/auras. A level 3 Earth Spike+Finger of Death+one auto attack deals around ~620 damage. Click on the enemy hero and do the maths to see if you can kill them with your combo.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Always be afraid of this guy. He can kill you with relative ease and makes disabling you seem such a breeze. If you see him suddenly start walking towards you, he's probably gearing up to Finger you or he's setting up for a gank.
</li></p><li><p>Mana Drain breaks if you go into fog. If he's draining you in lane, you may be able to stop the Drain quicker by going into tree fog rather than running out of the break distance.

<div id="47"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/lone_druid_full.png" alt="Lone Druid"></span><span id=name>Lone Druid</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Swap into Druid form if: You're healing HP (you're healing a larger percentage of your HP in Druid form), you're running back or from base or running around from camp to camp in the jungle (you have higher MS in Druid form), or you're trying for pro jukes (you can dodge stuns/attacks while you're Transforming). Swap into Bear form if: Nearly everything else.
</li></p><li><p>Don't be afraid of letting your Spirit Bear wander away from you. Use it to draw aggro from an incoming creep wave, stack jungle camps/ancients while you're freefarming, go shopping for you, go back to the Fountain to heal, burn down a creep wave or enemy jungle camp from across the map with Radiance, give a good position for Tinker to TP into, play blackjack with Death Prophet, or just scout for you.
</li></p><li><p>If your Spirit Bear just died and you're on the losing end of a team fight, don't just cast it again in the hopes that you can turn the fight around. Save it for when you respawn.
</li></p><li><p>Hold on to your skill point for your level 4 Spirit Bear until you get into a skirmish. Entangle has a 5s cooldown and lasts for 3s on a hero. When you skill up the bear its cooldowns are refreshed, making it possible to potentially double-entangle your target.
</li></p><li><p>Leveling up the bear also resets its blink damage cooldown timer, allowing you to blink it back or immediately resummon it when you level it up.
</li></p><li><p>Whenever you Recall the bear, it always appears on the top-right of your hero, regardless of what direction you're facing.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you see that the Spirit Bear suddenly has full HP in lane, it's a great time to kill Sylla since he probably just spawned a fresh one. If you manage to get him Bearless in lane, you just murdered his early game. If you manage to get him Bearless before a push, you get a tower for free.
</li></p><li><p>Killing the Spirit Bear will damage Lone Druid significantly. Sylla doesn't have much HP when he's not in True Form and killing his level 4 Spirit Bear will deal 400 damage to him. Plus, the bear is worth a lot of gold.
</li></p><li><p>Lone Druid is one of those heroes that allows for easy level 1 Rosh attempts. If you see him and Ursa, Lich, Wraith King, VS or a lot of other heroes, be sure to police the Rosh pit when you spawn.

<ul><li><p>Eclipse is married to Lucent Beam. If for some reason you're keeping Lucent Beam at low levels, Eclipse is going to be useless.
</li></p><li><p>Eclipse doesn't continue after you die, so don't use it if you're getting ganked just because you're angry that you got caught.
</li></p><li><p>Eclipse has a fairly long cast time. It's okay to cast it earlier than you need it just so you can get it off before getting perma-stunned.
</li></p><li><p>Eclipse turns the map to night for 10 seconds. If you see a bunch of enemies moments away from ganking you and you really don't want to die, you can use Eclipse's night to potentially hide yourself from enemy vision.
</li></p><li><p>You're not getting a Helm of the Dominator for the lifesteal, you're getting it so you can take a creep, send it to stack the ancients four times, and walk out a minute later with six hundred gold and two levels.

<ul><li><p>Luna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game, so as tempting as it can be to dive her in the early game, it can be risky without disables.
</li></p><li><p>Luna has 1800 vision at night once she levels Lunar Blessing, so you need to be sneaky if you're trying to gank her at night.
</li></p><li><p>Once your tier 3 tower goes down, get ready to enter Glaive City. Not only will this damage everything in sight but there is a high probability that your Blink Dagger is going to get disabled from an errant Glaive.

<div id="49"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/lycan_full.png" alt="Lycan"></span><span id=name>Lycan</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Wolves are quite possibly the strongest scouting tool in the game. Once they hit 4 you have two 460 move speed, permanently invisible, 55 second observer wards on demand. Use this to scout, check/kill runes, block/stack camps, body block targets, and most importantly, follow around high priority targets. If you want them to quietly hunt someone, issue a follow command. Press (default) M+left click on a hero. Your wolf will tail your target but never attack and break invisibility. However, be aware that when the duration of the wolf ends, the enemy hero will suddenly see a wolf keel over and die next to him, possibly compromising your sneakiness.
</li></p><li><p>When jungling or Roshing, you can shake neutral aggro off your wolves the same way you can drop tower aggro. Select the wolf in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should start focusing another unit.
</li></p><li><p>Howl is a game changing skill. It's practically a 10 second Demon Edge for your whole team at level 4. Pay attention to what your team is doing on the map and use it to help them even if you're not there.
</li></p><li><p>Always use Smoke before going into the Rosh pit.
</li></p><li><p>Don't feed Necronomicon creeps just for a few more seconds of tower damage. They're worth a sizable gold and experience bounty.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Pay attention to when the enemy team is Howl'd. Not only can you not trade hits with them now, but it can be a good signal that Lycan is Roshing.
</li></p><li><p>While you can't slow him when he's Shapeshifted, mass Eul's is a great way to keep him on lockdown. It's cheap enough that most people on your team can build it and it buys time for other stuns to come off cooldown.

<ul><li><p>Ranged allies are still benefiting from the bonus damage from Empower. You'll never be able to give Luna cleavage, but I'm sure she won't mind the extra damage.
</li></p><li><p>Skewer only goes as far as you click if you're not maxing out the range. I know you're really excited that you actually landed a 3-man RP, now just pan the camera a bit and you've got it made.
</li></p><li><p>No one is forcing you to use Skewer to drag enemies all willy nilly. You can also use it at close range mid-gank to inject a 40% slow with your horn, or use it to destroy a treeline to help your team close a gap.
</li></p><li><p>When Skewering to escape, don't freaking carpool with the people who are ganking you. It's smart to go past cliffs with Skewer, but it's dumb if you're bringing the enemy with you. Choose a Skewer destination that is not only far, but also at an angle that won't drag undesirables along for the ride.
</li></p><li><p>By default, your team of random pubs will generally assume that you're not going to Skewer after a good Reverse Polarity. It's worth sacrificing the positional benefit from Skewer just to make sure you're not causing your teammates to whiff their spells on where they thought the enemies would be.
</li></p><li><p>Keep your finger primed on the stop key when you're initiating or ganking. It's pretty easy to tell when you're about to whiff your RP, so be prepared to cancel your cast.
</li></p><li><p>After you blink into the enemy team, right click behind you as you cast RP. This'll get Magnus to rotate as you're casting RP and all the enemies get stunned at the desired Skewer angle without you having to run around behind them.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>When you're mid against Mag, it's obvious when he's trying to push the lane so that he can get the rune. He's going to auto attack all the creeps a bit and then he's going to Shockwave at a very predictable angle. There isn't much you can do to stop this (other than harassing him hard), but at least don't get hit by the Shockwave. It wasn't even meant for you.
</li></p><li><p>Reverse Polarity is one of those skills that's worth keeping track of, mainly because it's a stupid powerful ult, but also because it has a pretty easy to remember cooldown of ~2 minutes (120s, 110s, 100s).

<ul><li><p>If you're hitting a single target and Split Shot is toggled on, you're still taking the damage nerf. Stop taking Rosh or pushing creepless towers with Split Shot on.
</li></p><li><p>Illusions will either have Split Shot on or off depending on how you had it toggled before they spawned.
</li></p><li><p>The way the damage scales on Mystic Snake is opposite of Fade Bolt. You're gaining damage for each target hit, not losing it. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get the max damage.
</li></p><li><p>"Damn, I really wished I had Mana Shield turned off before that gank," said no Medusa ever. At a certain point in the game (read: after the laning phase) there are very few reasons to ever have Mana Shield turned off. Only if you're unsure if you'll have mana to use Stone Gaze should you have it off.
</li></p><li><p>Even though enemies have full magic resistance when in Stone Form, Mystic Snake will deal pure damage to any petrified targets.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you don't know where Medusa is in the first 2 minutes of the game, then you know exactly where Medusa is. The ancient strat is cute, but also pretty simple to counter. You got the "Put a ward to block the camp," the "sentry her ward so she doesn't know what to do," the old "sit around and intermittently harass her so she can't decide if you've left her alone yet or not," the crafty "cut an extra tree down and watch her panic," and the classic "bring 3 heroes in to waste her and then take her stacks."
</li></p><li><p>If you don't know where Medusa is in the next 40 minutes of the game, then you know exactly why Medusa isn't a popular hero. If you can't beat the enemies 4v5 in the midgame, then you weren't going to beat them late anyway.
</li></p><li><p>When a Mystic Snake gets tossed out on the lane ask yourself, "Would Fade Bolt be able to jump to me from here?" If you said yes, then you probably already got hit by it.

</li></p><li><p>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep one somewhere safe in the jungle.

<ul><li><p>You're only getting the second Starstorm hit on a target if it's in 325 range of you.
</li></p><li><p>The idea behind landing consistent arrows is trying to throw them in a way that gives you a large window to hit a target and a small window for them to notice the arrow. If you're tossing out arrows that are 90 degrees opposite your target, you're giving yourself a very small frame for the arrow to hit. It can be smart to sacrifice some time of the target running to give yourself a more forgiving/parallel angle.
</li></p><li><p>The more realistic idea behind landing consistent arrows is pairing it with other stuns or disables.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to the map to see if you can use Moonlight Shadow to help out teammates.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If there's a Mirana on the enemy team, treat her like a Pudge as far as movement and positioning is concerned. Hug creeps, don't stand still, and get mad at your teammates for being arrow magnets.
</li></p><li><p>If you suspect Mirana is hanging around a tower that you're TPing to, target your TP directly on to the tower. You'll show up at a random spot in a circle around the tower, making it difficult for her to predict an arrow.

</li></p><li><p>Replicate has a surprisngly high cast range. Use this not only to make Replicas of enemies from far away during team fights, but as a gap closer during ganks (create a Replica, immediately take its position, you are now in your target) or as an escape when getting ganked.
</li></p><li><p>When using a Replica to escape, treat it like an Illusory Orb. Let your hero walk in one direction and let the Replica go the opposite direction. Doesn't matter which one the enemies commit to, you're gold ponyboy.
</li></p><li><p>If you're farming the jungle and you've got nothing better to do, micro your Replicate. Besides letting it get last hits for you, you can try sending it into enemy territory to bait out some ultimates.
</li></p><li><p>Replicas deal 50% damage. A 50% damage Agh Tiny still hurts like crazy, whether he's the enemy or your ally. Find the highest damage dealer in the map and Replicate them for a team fight. Replicas also take 100% damage. A 100% HP Centaur takes an eternity to kill. If the highest damage dealer in the map is also someone who gets iced out in moments (i.e. Clinkz), then try to go for the tankiest.
</li></p><li><p>Other good targets for Replication are heroes who have good passives or auras which carry over to illusions: Axe for Counter Helix, Phantom Lancer for your own personal PL army, Spectre for Desolate, Riki for Permanent Invisibility, and heroes who have a Radiance.

<ul><li><p>You need to have nukes if you want to kill Morph. With STR Morph, he can usually gain HP before you can burn him down with auto attacks.
</li></p><li><p>Be wary of committing fully to out of position heroes when there's a Morphling on the enemy team. It's highly likely that it's a Replicate.
</li></p><li><p>If Morph went E-Blade, he's probably roaming around with low strength, making him a prime candidate for a good old fashioned Nyxing. Good Nyxers include: Nyx, Nyx, Nyx, Io+Anyone, Nyx, and Dagon 5 + Sheepstick Tinker or Furion.

<ul><li><p>Mirror Image can purge all the debuffs that a Manta would (besides Silences, obviously). Look at the lane you're up against to see if an early Mirror Image could save your skin (like for Open Wounds or Grave Chill). Mirror Image's split time also allows you to be invulnerable when projectile spells like Wraith King or Sven's stuns hit.
</li></p><li><p>Send a unified move command (look in your options to find out what the key modifier is, by default it's CTRL) after you split otherwise it's super obvious which Naga Naga Naga Naga is 100% Naga. Or if you're a fan of Mindgamez™, send a lone illusion out from the school and act nonchalant while the enemies gun it down.
</li></p><li><p>Although couriers possess an unparalleled understanding on the intricacies of space and time, they are like dolphins and get caught in those six-pack plastic can things all the time. Ensnare will bind both walking and flying couriers.
</li></p><li><p>After you hit 6 and you're quietly farming, you should always try to keep at least 175 mana in the bank. 100 for the Song, 75 for the TP.
</li></p><li><p>If you aren't partied up in a 5 stack, just use your ult defensively. <i>"Buuuut moooom, all the other heroes get to press R in a team fight." "Maybe when you're older, Slithice. Why can't you be like that nice boy Terrorblade and use your ult situationally?"</i>
</li></p><li><p>You didn't listen to me, did you. You used it. See, Naga, this is why we can't trust you... Now look. Everyone is shuffling around awkwardly on your team because they're both seething with rage and because they can't tell if you want to commit to this failed fight or not. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Just press R again. Yeah that's right, you can cancel your ult. You can just act like it was a misclick.
</li></p><li><p>Supposing you DO have a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some notable interactions with it. <b>Razor</b> - Sleep doesn't stop Static Link. <b>Undying</b> - Zombies continue to spawn on sleeping enemies. <b>Warlock</b> - Channel a fat Upheaval during the Sleep. <b>Dazzle</b> - Weave can hit Sleeping enemies and will continue to tick during the Sleep. <b>Omniknight</b> - You can offensively Repel one enemy to bring them out of Sleep.
</li></p><li><p>If an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out, you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the spell immune enemy.
</li></p><li><p>Enemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't. This allows you to get uncontestable and rage inducing denies on towers.
</li></p><li><p>If you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin channeling your TP.
</li></p><li><p>There aren't many situations in which you want to use all 7 seconds of your ult. If you catch someone out with it, cancel it as soon as people are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more time to get over there.
</li></p><li><p>Roshan is deaf. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Be wary of activating any sort of spell immunity before Naga uses Sleep, otherwise you might be setting yourself up to die before the team fight even starts.
</li></p><li><p>Glyph makes towers immune to Sleep, allowing them to continue firing.
</li></p><li><p>Ensnare will interrupt any channels, reveal you if you're invis, disable you from blinking, and go through spell immunity.

<ul><li><p>Sprout gives flying vision for some reason. Like a huge radius of flying vision. Use Sprout to scout enemies who are juking in a jungle, counter ward cliffs, or to get that last hit on the flying courier who just flew out of vision.
</li></p><li><p>Target your Sprout during your TP animation when you're going in for a gank. You'll cast it as soon as you're in range and have vision of the target, rather than fumbling around the moment you get there and inadvertently trapping your allies. The spell can be hero targeted, so you only rarely need to skillshot it (only when the enemy is spell immune, or you're trying to guess where an invis hero went).
</li></p><li><p>Carry a TP scroll. It makes it incredibly difficult for you to get punished for TPing in to snipe couriers, killing fleeing heroes, or pulling down a tower's pants and backdooring it.
</li></p><li><p>95% of the raising the roof animation for Teleport won't break the invis granted by Shadow Blade.
</li></p><li><p>You can use Teleportation to mindgame enemies. If you see your teammate is getting ganked, start casting a TP right on top of the enemies, even if you only have 10 HP, just to freak them out. The animation is pretty obvious and is long enough that you can easily cancel it.
</li></p><li><p>When ganking in the early game, TP into places out of vision like inside the side shop or behind the lane.
</li></p><li><p>How to avoid dying as Prophet: Step 1: Run away a little bit. Step 2: Cast Sprout on yourself (you can use double tap to self cast if it's enabled) so no one can see you during your private time. Step 3: Double tap the TP hotkey to automatically target the fountain. Step 4: Do it all over again in 45 seconds because the enemy never learns.
</li></p><li><p>If you're TPing from the fountain to start pushing a lane, queue up a Nature's Call on the nearest group of trees. You should be able to recoup most of the mana lost with residual Fountain regen.
</li></p><li><p>Treants are great units for cutting off a creep wave. Just end one up ahead to lead the enemy creeps on a wild goose chase while you continue beating on the tower.
</li></p><li><p>Learn how his ult works and how to maximize the damage on high priority targets. You typically only want to cast it if you can see heroes on the minimap and at least 2 lanes have creeps fighting at the moment.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>QUELLING BLAAAAADE. Also Tangoes. Few spells can lose effectiveness so dramatically from such cheap items. If your ally is Sprouted, be a pal and use one of these to get them out. Learn which spells can break trees as well (especially the not so obvious ones like Tether, Split Earth, Light Strike Array, Tombstone, etc). These can also come in handy to invade NP's little home when he Sprouts himself to TP out. Keep at least 1 Tango or my QB on hand in the mid game if you don't have any of these spells.
</li></p><li><p>Keep a close eye on your courier and get it up and flying ASAP against an enemy Prophet. Save the haste for when it's on its way back to the fountain.
</li></p><li><p>If you see an ult bouncing around, back out of the lane to get out of vision and stay there for a few seconds. If you're wondering how his ult just hit you in the middle of your jungle, either Riki is stalking you or they have a ward.
</li></p><li><p>Save your stun/silence for the end of his Teleport animation. He's disabling himself for free while he's mid-animation. Let him think that he's going to get out while you're whittling him down with auto attacks, then disable his cast at the last moment.
</li></p><li><p>Prophet faces in the direction that he's TPing. While not always useful, if you see him Teleporting you can warn your teammates where he's probably traveling to.

<ul><li><p>"Nah he's dead, Death Pulse will kill him." HAHAHAHA, no. Death Pulse never gets them. Always finish the kill either with Heartstopper, Scythe, or auto attacks.
</li></p><li><p>Death Pulse can hit invis and fogged units.
</li></p><li><p>People skip Heartstopper Aura because it pushes the lane. Oh does it? Does it really? Yes it does, it's about one auto attack per every melee creep in the wave's worth of damage at level 1. People also assume it's worthless because they aren't seeing a huge white chunk growing on the enemies HP bar. Heartstopper is the long con. Enemies will suddenly realize they have a strong urge to eat tangoes and the support will wonder how they're losing so much HP every time they go to harass you. If you're in an aggressive lane, you should definitely get at least one level of this spell. If you're in a defensive lane, you should still consider it.
</li></p><li><p>The stun on Reaper's Scythe goes through BKB. That's neat.
</li></p><li><p>For heroes with standard magic resistance the magic numbers for getting a kill with Scythe are at 23%/31%/40% of HP remaining.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're on the run from a potentially fatal Death Pulse, a cute tactic is to get the courier to use a Salve on you to bypass the brief cast time of popping open the flask and lathering up.

<ul><li><p>You don't need to pop everything on one target during a gank. Silence one hero, Void another hero, then kill them all.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid taking traditional ganking routes if possible. You're crazy fast at night so you can afford to sacrifice some travel time in order to avoid walking into the typical warded areas.
</li></p><li><p>Use TPs liberally during night time. Show yourself in one lane, then TP to another once the wave dies. This makes your ganks far more unpredictable.
</li></p><li><p>Buy your own wards if you need to. It takes no time at all for you to run into the enemy jungle to ward it up and you'll make back the gold in just one kill.
</li></p><li><p>Leveling Darkness at 6 is situational. If you would rather make your killing potential higher with another level in Hunter for the first night, skip Darkness until later.
</li></p><li><p>To fully exploit Darkness, you really need to understand how blind enemies are when it's active. Every enemy hero, ward, and building will have vision in only a 675 radius around them when it's Night Stalker O'Clock. That's essentially auto attack range for ranged heroes.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>NS is essentially an M1 Abrams with wings. Dude has 5.5 armor right off the bat. This is what makes him such a terrifying tower diver.

</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="59"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/nyx_assassin_full.png" alt="Nyx Assassin"></span><span id=name>Nyx Assassin</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Nyx gets the luxury of easy positioning that Lion doesn't get, making multi hero Impales much simpler. Vendetta one hero and then roughly target the Impale on the other hero. Since you're in such close range to your first target, you will most likely nyx them both with the Impale.
</li></p><li><p>Mana Burn does more raw damage on INT heroes, but mana is a much more expensive resource on STR and AGI heroes. Nyx wisely.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Spiked Carapace while in Vendetta and the invis won't be removed.
</li></p><li><p>Use Vendetta for the damage mid game, but use it to get a good stun late game. The nuke is still useful, but people will have BKBs and be grouped up late game, making it a lot harder to fully nyx someone without getting stopped.
</li></p><li><p>At level 16 Vendetta cooldown is the same as the duration. Try to make things happen during the tail end of the duration so that you can Vendetta out if things go poorly or to get a double Vendetta for maximum nyxing.
</li></p><li><p>Oh boy, a hero where Dagon is core! That's great. Upgrading it to Dagon 5 is not core. Unless you're straight up nyxin' outta control, you should probably work on a late game item or a Blink Dagger after Dagon 1/2.
</li></p><li><p>Be on the map as little as possible. The less time you spend nyxing around in lane, the less willing the enemies are to farm.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Vendetta while you're channeling a TP. Nyx.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Be aware of your damage sources. Nyx can Carapace you off of Radiance burn, any DoT you put on him, and some units you own that damaged him.
</li></p><li><p>Resist the urge to retaliate whenever he blows his full combo on you. Nyxs almost always Carapace as soon as they finish their sequence. Just walk away. Be the bigger man. Don't stun/kill yourself.
</li></p><li><p>Try to bait out Carapace by casting and canceling spells with obvious animations (Split Earth, Thunder Clap, Shockwave, etc).

<ul><li><p>Ogre can trade hits with the best of them in lane. Dude has nearly 7 armor to start and a bucket of HP. To give perspective, he has more EHP at spawn than a level 6 Crystal Maiden. Plus he has 2.5HP/s passive regen to boot. Love the chuft, fear the chuft.
</li></p><li><p>At max Multicast, the range on Ignite is nearly the same as Blink Dagger range. This can be a really simple way to turn off an initiator's Blink Dagger for ~10 seconds.
</li></p><li><p>An early level in Bloodlust can be a big deal. 10% movement speed can very easily turn around or secure a gank.
</li></p><li><p>Once you're level 16, you should be butter churning Bloodlust into every allied unit on the map if you have the mana. Heroes, creeps, Spirit Bear, siege creeps... Beastmaster's Hawk?
</li></p><li><p>The courier can also be given the lust for Blood.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Even though running's not as fun as hitting, Ogre is a chaser extraordinaire. His only downfall is his slow cast times. If Ogre's chasing you down, try running into fog from trees often.

<ul><li><p>Purification has an extremely long cast animation, but you can use this to your advantage in lane. Most melee heroes will immediately back off a last hit if they see Omni start throwing down prayers. So cast it and cancel it.
</li></p><li><p>Spam Repel. If you're sitting around babysitting a carry in lane and everyone is off the map, use it. If you're going into dangerous areas to ward, use it. If you envision some sort of 3600 range initiation possibly happening when the two teams are toeing off, use it. You get 12 Omniscient seconds of spell immunity for 50 mana. If your ally is straight stupid and doesn't reposition themselves at the end of the duration they deserve to get punished for the two seconds before it comes off CD again. Yes, it's great when you can get enemies to waste their stuns and then Repel them off, but most of the time your allies will get killed first because your cast animation takes like 20 minutes and the range on Repel is pretty lame.
</li></p><li><p>One of the few uses of offensive Repels is to purge off enemy runes or spells like Surge. Pretty much the only other use is to take an enemy out of Naga sleep. Other than that, you misclicked and you should feel bad.
</li></p><li><p>Use Guardian Angel more like a Mek than Shallow Grave. There's no reason you can't start getting dat Omniscient love with your team once they're all at half HP, rather than in Culling Blade range.
</li></p><li><p>Omniscience is core for fountain diving. Guardian Angel will completely negate any damage from the fountain machine gun.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Probably the best hero in the game to get a Diffusal Blade against. Lifestealer running away with a sliver of health and Guardian Angel? Purge it. Storm Spirit being an annoying dick and diving in 2 tiers deep because he's Repelled? HeyyyyloeverybodythisisPurge it. The fact that Omni is also worthless if you burn off all his mana is just gravy.
</li></p><li><p>Eul's Cyclone, Invoker's Tornado, and Storm Panda's Cyclone (and obviously Purge) can also dispel Guardian Angel.
</li></p><li><p>Rubick's wet dream. "Oh I better cast something before Rubick steals Guardian Angel... but I don't want him getting Repel. Wait, I don't want him getting Purification either..."

<ul><li><p>Stack your Imprisonments on the same target, especially if they are INT heroes since it'll cut their right click damage. It's also okay to also stack Imprisonments on heroes with high-cost spells, like Tiny and Pudge, so they are too dumb to cast anything.
</li></p><li><p>Time Imprisonments right before the enemy goes for a last hit. It's super annoying to get Harbinged right before killing a creep.
</li></p><li><p>Try to pull off an Imprisonment on an enemy before using your ult. At level 16, one Imprisonment should give you an extra ~200 magical damage on that target and ~100 extra damage on everyone else. Just make sure you're not Imprisoning a high priority target that needed to get targeted by the rest of your team.
</li></p><li><p>If you're getting ganked in the early game, try using a Bottle charge or some sort of regen item right before self-Imprisoning yourself. The regen will continue healing while you're banished.
</li></p><li><p>You want to use Sanity's Eclipse as early in a team fight as possible so that you can actually take advantage of the fat mana burn on some heroes. WHOA IT HAS A MANA BURN? It has a mana burn.
</li></p><li><p>Refresher beats Agh in both giving you a stronger right click and in buffing Sanity's Eclipse. That being said, you probably shouldn't be going for either of these unless you're in a 70 minute game or against 5 strength heroes.

<ul><li><p>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane. Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.
</li></p><li><p>Always be on the lookout for allied units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.
</li></p><li><p>Please get at least one level in Blur early. Pretty please. If not for the evasion, get it for detection purposes. Blur triggers on invisible and fogged heroes that are in a 1600 radius around from you. If you suddenly become de-Blurred, a hero is likely coming to gank you.
</li></p><li><p>You can also use this to scout enemies when roaming around the map or when checking the Rosh pit.
</li></p><li><p>Coup de Grâce makes it incredibly frustrating to grab CS while pushing, so take down the creeps that are being focused the least when the waves clash (ranged creep first, then that one melee creep that was late to the party, then that's about it).
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>A Magic Stick may be a good investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to spam Dagger.
</li></p><li><p>If you're a carry, get a MKB. If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter. If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail.
</li></p><li><p>A BKB also makes it very difficult for PA to start dealing damage to you since she can't slow you down with Dagger or target you to get her boosted attack speed with Phantom Strike.
</li></p><li><p>The minimap will not help you against PA. Many times you'll be farming your lane and you'll see a mass of creeps hanging out at one of your towers on the map and you'll think, "Eh, no one's there, the tower will push it back." Then all of a sudden PA is knocking on your tier 2. Actually pan around the map to verify if PA is truly off the map or not.

<ul><li><p>Illusory Orb is your main escape before you get your Blink Dagger. The second you toss out an Orb to damage some creeps, your fairie dragon ass starts looking much tastier to kill. This is most relevant when you're in the mid lane and you're trying to push the wave to get the rune. Only use the orb if you're confident that you can't get nuked down in the next ~10s.
</li></p><li><p>When pushing, cast Illusory Orb from the back of the enemy creep wave towards your creeps or into trees and then Jaunt to it. This can help create a buffer from players who will try to gank you once they see your orb is down.
</li></p><li><p>Illusory Orb gives a huge amount of flying vision. Not only does it give vision around the Orb itself, but the vision lingers for a few seconds along its path as well. Use it for scouting, shutting down juking, or finishing off couriers.
</li></p><li><p>There are three main ways to Jaunt the full distance reliably. Either you watch for the Orb to turn red, listen to the sound pitch of the Orb, or use the Orb's spell icon as a clock. The Orb travels for 3 seconds, so Jaunt in right before the spell cooldown timer hits 9. Or you can just count to 3.
</li></p><li><p>When you're on the run, toss an Orb in one direction and continue walking in another direction. If they commit to the Orb, don't Jaunt, if they commit to you, keep walking.
</li></p><li><p>Puck can completely avoid spells like Ice Path and even insta-cast spells like Hexes while Phase Shifted as long as you blink in the direction you were facing before you Phase Shifted AND if Blink <i>before</i> the channel ends. If you try to blink in a different direction, you'll spend too much time turning around after Phase Shift and if you shift-queue, spells like Ice Path will still hit you.
</li></p><li><p>You only need to cast Phase Shift to disjoint things, you don't need to complete the channel. If a tower shot is about to pound you, just tap Phase Shift and keep moving.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>As soon as the Orb comes out, start looking for the kill. Puck may be hard to lock down, but Orb being on cooldown halves this hero's survivability in the early game.
</li></p><li><p>Illusory Orb travels for three seconds. Most stuns last ~2 seconds. Save your stun for around 1 second after an enemy Puck tosses out an Orb. If they Jaunt within that second, they didn't get very far anyway so whatever.
</li></p><li><p>Playing against Puck mid is all about baiting out useless Phase Shifts. Animation canceling is usually the easiest way, but smart Pucks ain't about that cancel lyfe and won't get scared by your Magnus practicing lacrosse with Shockwave canceling. So just wait for them to use Phase Shift for some other reason (tower shots, creep aggro) or try to bait it by tossing out a less important spell (Shadow Strike is the textbook example) or an auto-attack.
</li></p><li><p>Dream Coil always lasts for 6 seconds (unless Scepter'd).
</li></p><li><p>You can break out of the Coil without getting stunned with spells like Waveform or Ball Lightning. You can Blink out as well, but you'll take the damage and be stunned when you land.

</li></p><li><p>You can Hook units that are Cycloned. They won't take any damage, but you will change their position.
</li></p><li><p>Part of being a good Pudge is more than landing Hooks, but also knowing when your Hooks won't land. The cast time is long enough that you should be able to at least occasionally stop-cancel failed Hooks.
</li></p><li><p>Arguably the most reliable way of predicting enemy movement for Hooks during the laning phase is to watch for last hits. While you're hiding, watch the HP of your creeps and wait for the enemy to pick up the last hit. The knowledge of where they will be plus their attack animation should be enough to land a Hook fairly easily.
</li></p><li><p>It's possible to have someone Dismembered but not in Rot range, so turn off Rot if you're not seeing their HP steadily trickle down.
</li></p><li><p>You can Salve up through the first 3 levels of Rot without it being dispelled. This applies to Pudge himself and any enemies he's Rotting.
</li></p><li><p>One relatively safe method to intentionally deny yourself is to start Dismembering whoever is chasing you while you Rot yourself to death.
</li></p><li><p>Spam toggle Rot to keep the slow on a target, but take minimal damage.
</li></p><li><p>Walking up to a hero and Dismembering them without Hooking them is like getting body shots as a Sniper in TF2. No one will respect you, but who cares when you get the kill.
</li></p><li><p>Practice targeting Dismember while an enemy is getting Hooked to give enemies as little time to react as possible and to ensure you ult them in the Rot radius.
</li></p><li><p>When Roshing, don't use Dismember unless you're absolutely safe. It's a huge red flag for the enemy team that Pudge is off enjoying some fresh Rosh meat (the sound is global every time you cast it) despite the fact there is no hero on the map getting Benihana'd.
</li></p><li><p>Don't <i>ever</i> shift-queue Meat Hook after Dismember. You are almost always better off canceling the last few milliseconds of Dismember by casting Meat Hook rather than waiting for the channel to end.
</li></p><li><p>Never let Rubick steal Meat Hook. Constantly be spamming Rot against a Rubick.
</li></p><li><p>The Undisputed Heavyweight Illusion Rune Champion. No one likes getting illusion runes, but on Pudge, they're great. Don't have perfect micro skills? Of course you don't, you're playing Pudge. Get this, just plop a lone illusion the enemy's end of the river staring at the creep wave. You just got so far deep into their mid's head you could write his biography. While he's sweating bullets on the opposite end of the wave, walk your real self over and land the easiest hook of your life.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Play the hero and read the tips. The best way to beat a Pudge is to become the Pudge. You put Pudge into a cup, he becomes the cup, you put Pudge into a teapot, he becomes the teapot. Be Pudge, my friend.
</li></p><li><p>Target your TP directly on to the tower if you don't know where Pudge is. You'll show up at a random spot in a circle around the tower, making it difficult for him to predict a hook.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="68"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/pugna_full.png" alt="Pugna"></span><span id=name>Pugna</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Nether Blast damages towers and siege creeps. You don't get bonus damage for engulfing the whole tower, which is what some Pugnas seem to think. Keep the tower on the edge of the Blast AoE and focus the majority of the Blast on the creep wave.
</li></p><li><p>Nether Blast is an great spell to cast and stop-cancel. The animation is extremely obvious, but the lack of any visual feedback makes it difficult for the enemy to tell if you canceled it or not. Eventually they'll call your bluff, at which point you can start getting lazy with your Stop key.
</li></p><li><p>You can Decrepify the Nether Ward, effectively making it invulnerable for 2-3.5s. You can also Decrepify Undying's Tombstone.
</li></p><li><p>Check yourself before you Decrep yourself. In a 1v1 situation you usually want to Decrep the enemy, when there are multiple enemies you usually want to Decrep yourself, when there is a team fight, you should try to save your Decrep for your nether ward.
</li></p><li><p>Decrepify makes you immune to physical damage even from spells, such as Jugg's Omnislash or Dazzle's Shadow Wave.
</li></p><li><p>Lane and neutral creeps will immediately drop aggro if you are Decrepified. If you're sneaking behind enemy lines and a creep is following you, Decrepify yourself and it'll lose interest. This is also extremely useful for tower dives if you're willing to eat a slow, since both the tower and creeps will ignore you.
</li></p><li><p>Nether Ward's mana degen is significant, especially in lane. Find a nice cozy place to hide it and revel in how huge a 1600 radius is.
</li></p><li><p>Life Drain creeps to heal yourself up after a team fight. Don't bother trying to regen mana from creeps though, that part only works on hero targets.
</li></p><li><p>You can target Life Drain on allies to heal them at the cost of your own HP.
</li></p><li><p>Since Life Drain works on non-hero units, you can deny yourself in a pinch by Life Draining yourself into an allied creep.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>The Nether Ward will toast you before your spell comes out. The spell won't be put on cooldown if you die, though.
</li></p><li><p>If you're in the Nether Ward's AoE, you will see a debuff icon in your status bar.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>There's a cast time on Shadow Strike, so stop-cancel it to bait out defensive spells from enemies.
</li></p><li><p>Only Blink to initiate if you're absolutely positive that the enemies can't take a fight when you show up. If it turns out that Lion had just enough mana for a Hex and now Ursa is TPing in, that 6s cooldown is going to feel like an eternity.
</li></p><li><p>Scream of Pain can hit invis units and units in fog.
</li></p><li><p>Sonic Wave can kill couriers.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Shadow Strike is not a constant DoT. There's an initial nuke damage when the projectile hits and then a tick of damage every 3 seconds (5 ticks, for 15 seconds). Get a quick Bottle sip or Armlet toggle between ticks to stay alive.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Strike's projectile can be completely disjointed by invisibility.
</li></p><li><p>Watch her Blink animation to determine the direction that she Blinks in. The particle 'cone' always points in the direction that she goes.
</li></p><li><p>QoP can be built in a number of ways which will influence how she will be played. If you're seeing an Oblivion Staff or Mystic Staff, watch for ganks because she's probably going Orchid or Sheep, if you're seeing a Point Booster, watch for team fights because she's probably going Agh or Bloodstone, if you're seeing an Ogre Club or Perseverance, she's probably going BKB or Linken's and is probably going to semi-carry.

<ul><li><p>Plasma Field gives you flying vision as it travels out.
</li></p><li><p>Static Link gives vision around your target hero as well.
</li></p><li><p>You can Static Link spell immune units both before and during spell immunity. You can Static Link an illusion and still steal damage. You can Static Link the Spirit Bear. You can Static Link a sleeping hero without them waking up, making Bane+Razor a meaaaan lane and Naga+Razor a meaaaan team fight comp. Pretty much the only thing that can stop Static Link is the enemy moving out of the break radius.
</li></p><li><p>If you're worried more about dealing damage than stealing damage it's okay to Link the Crystal Maiden to buff up your damage if Luna keeps breaking the Link. You can sap more damage than a hero actually has, so CM will see a fat red -168 by her measly 63 damage.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Just because Razor died doesn't mean you get all your damage back instantly, and just because you died doesn't mean Razor won't keep dealing +200 damage. Static Link's buff/debuff will remain for the full duration.
</li></p><li><p>Razor's ultimate gets affected by damage block, making Crimson Guard a fairly good item for neutralizing some of Eye of the Storm's damage.

<div id="71"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11778482/HEROTIPS/herotips_files/riki.png" alt="Riki"></span><span id=name>Riki</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Smoke Screen. Great silence, great blind, great slow, great range. So don't hotbox your gank target in the center of the cloud unless you're terrified of them casting something, just leave them near the edge of the AoE. By reflex, most enemies won't even realize that you duped them until they're halfway through the cloud.
</li></p><li><p>You can Blink Strike to allies as well as enemies. And like all other pseudo-Blinks you can cast it while Frostbitten or Ensnared.
</li></p><li><p>Blink Strike works on couriers.
</li></p><li><p>You still have collision when you're in Permanent Invisibility, so don't bump into enemies you're stalking.
</li></p><li><p>Riki has ridiculously high armor to start (5.7), but you also have like no HP to back it up. You're armored jello until you get a damage block item like Poor Man's Shield or more HP.
</li></p><li><p>Diffusal Blade is considered core on Riki for three main reasons: 1. Riki loves AGI items. 2. You can Purge enemies to keep them in your Smoke Screen even longer. 3. You can Purge Dust, you can Purge Amplify Damage, and you can Purge Track off yourself.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p><i>Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit greedy when you realize that you've got no farm. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit tired of listening to all the 'missing' calls. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit nervous when you're in your jungle without any wards. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit scared 'cause now you're standing in a purple cloud. AND I NEED A STUN RIGHT NOW, AND I NEED ONE MORE THAN EVER.</i> Rikis hate attacking heroes who decide to hold a staring contest rather than run scared. He is practically working with a Double Damage rune from Backstab when your back is turned, so if you think you can last the Smoke's duration, turn around and have a chat with him. Most of your attacks will miss, and you're still going to be silenced, but if backup is coming, put your man pants on and fight him. Even if backup isn't coming, turn around and then start TPing. All of this is assuming that you're not playing Bristleback, though.
</li></p><li><p>Good anti-Riki items as a support include pretty much any mid-game support item. Smoke Screen stops you from using spells, not items. Force Staff is the typical pickup, Eul's is good, and Ghost Scepter is good. For late game, you'll pretty much always want to go for a Necro 3, Orchid, or Sheep.
</li></p><li><p>Riki holds a strong grudge against both King Bars. BKB and MKB are both good carry items against a Riki because they both allow you to fight in the Smoke.
</li></p><li><p>Practice the buddy system. Riki can't really deal with solo-ganking two heroes at the same time.
</li></p><li><p>Don't make it obvious that you have a Sentry Ward down in the lane unless you're ready to go for the kill.
</li></p><li><p>Keep your Spidey senses on point. If you notice that your hero is doing some peculiar pathing or stutter stepping for some reason, Riki's probably following you around, gently licking you.
</li></p><li><p>When pushing, place a Sentry Ward in/around/behind your team out of the Tower's sight. If your team hasn't been super aggressive with detection, it's highly likely that Riki is ghost riding your whip and waiting for the perfect Smoke.

<div id="72"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/rubick_full.png" alt="Rubick"></span><span id=name>Rubick</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Telekinesis is a damn good disable mainly because Rubick has essentially non-existent cast times. For the most part, Telekinesis can be pulled off just as quickly as a Hex. So if you're worried an initiator is about to blink in and start a team fight, keep spam casting and canceling it on their initiator so that once they blink in range, you'll instantly pick them up.
</li></p><li><p>Rubick has to be looking in the direction that you want to cast Telekinesis Land, so if you're trying to escape either cast the Land immediately after picking an enemy up or not at all.
</li></p><li><p>Generally you want to cast the Land as soon as possible anyway so that your allies can see where you're dropping the enemy and can plan accordingly.
</li></p><li><p>If you're getting chased by multiple heroes, it can be smart to cast the Land towards you, rather than away from you. During the Lift's duration, the other enemies will have probably passed your target up, so the Land should stun them on the way back.
</li></p><li><p>One of the hallmarks of a strong anti-pusher is the ability to draw aggro from a creep wave off of a tower during pushes. Fade Bolt is probably one of the strongest spells in the game to do this, mainly because of its zero cast time, huge range, damage reduction ability, and substantial nuke damage. When you want to slow down the enemy's push, cast it on the creep wave and the creeps will lose interest in hammering your tower and come for you instead.
</li></p><li><p>You can Spell Steal through spell immunity. Just because Enigma is a big golden tear drop doesn't mean you can't steal Black Hole through BKB.
</li></p><li><p>Patience is a virtue. Don't steal spells all willy nilly. Go into a team fight knowing the spells that you would want to steal and wait for them to be cast. You'll only be able to steal ~2 spells per team fight, so make them count.
</li></p><li><p>Rubick has zero cast times on any stolen spells. Forget everything you know about landing Leshrac's Split Earth, be amazed at how you can ejaculate a Fissure in a split second, and revel in how much better a spell Zeus's Lightning Bolt is when you don't have to fist pump for half a second to cast it.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Rubick being in your lane automatically adds another ~375 units that you need to keep in your safety zone because of instant Telekinesis. Don't let him into your zone.
</li></p><li><p>Rubick is all about capitalizing on your forgetfulness/laziness. "Oh right, they have a Rubick, I should have cast Anchor Smash after Ravage. I should have cast Blade Fury after Omnislash. I should have cast Flak Cannon after Rocket Barrage." Put a condom on all of your spells, it's 99% effective.
</li></p><li><p>Always check what spell Rubick has stolen by clicking on him. If you're Pudge and Rubick just Ghostbuster'd your essence, there is a big difference in how the next minute is going to go down if he stole Rot or if he stole Meat Hook.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="73"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/sand_king_full.png" alt="Sand King"></span><span id=name>Sand&nbsp;King</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>The only reason you shouldn't hero-target Burrowstrike is if you're going for multi-hero stuns or if you're trying to achieve a very specific position. Unlike Impale, the bonus range granted by skillshotting Burrowstrike is barely anything (~100 units extra).
</li></p><li><p>The combination of him having no cast times, Burrowstrike being a stunning Force Staff that doesn't break trees, zero fade time on Sandstorm, and the fact that Blink Dagger is a core item makes Sand King's jukeability extremely potent. Use all of this to your advantage and be unpredictable. Cast Sandstorm, but then immediately change directions while you're invisible. Use Burrowstrike+Sandstorm to disjoint attacks until your Blink Dagger comes off cooldown. Burrowstrike into the trees and start TPing. The only limit is yourself. And your mana.
</li></p><li><p>You typically want to avoid leveling Caustic Finale early because it pushes the lane unless you're against a melee carry, multiple melee heroes, or aggressive pushers. If you are, then definitely level it. Then poke every creep in the lane. Then Burrowstrike. Then get kills.
</li></p><li><p>If you're planning on channeling an Epicenter post-Burrowstrike, aim the Burrowstrike so you end up behind the enemy. Not even an instant Hex will be able to cancel it because you'll finish the channel in the time they spend turning around to cast the Hex on you.
</li></p><li><p>If you are going to shift-queue your Blink Dagger after the Epicenter channel, choose your destination at the very last second. Things can change in a two second channel time. Positions can move, TPs come in, blinks go out, empires fall.
</li></p><li><p>Veil of Discord is made for this hero. The huge cast range, long debuff duration, and large AoE make it the perfect companion for Epicenter.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>You really need to have at least one non-targeted Stun or Silence on your team against Sandy Claws. Standing around Sandstorm and realizing that absolutely no one on your team can break the channel is both frustrating and embarrassing. Sentry Wards will help, but having to throw down a Sentry Ward against every Sandstorm will be a massive waste of money.
</li></p><li><p>You may not be able to stun/silence him out of his Epicenter channel, but you can still disable his Blink Dagger with damage. Wasting 2-4 pulses for a 0.1s Illuminate or some other long range spell is a great trade.
</li></p><li><p>Probably the second best hero in the game to get a Pipe against after Zeus.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="74"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/shadow_demon_full.png" alt="Shadow Demon"></span><span id=name>Shadow Demon</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you select your Disruption illusions you can see how the enemy is skilling themselves since your illusions' skill points will mirror the enemy's. For example, since Shadow Demon is a popular pick against Anti-Mage (because the illusions will Mana Break AM), you can use this to see how AM is skilling himself (maxing Mana Break, maxing Blink, or taking stats).
</li></p><li><p>There are pretty much only two reasons why you should ever Disrupt an ally to save them. Either you're trying to burn off 2.5 seconds of a disable they're in or they're about to die and you're using it like a Shallow Grave. For slows, blinds, silences, or disarms, unless you're communicating with your allies, avoid Disrupting them. 9 times out of 10, people will get mad at you even if they were dead anyway.
</li></p><li><p>However, there are tons of great situations to use Disruption on allies in other situations. During tower pushes, make more Lunas for maximum glaives. During defenses, make fake Batriders and send one in. When warding, make more yous to bait a gank attempt.
</li></p><li><p>Soul Catcher will never catch siege creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Disruption banishes a target for 2.5 seconds. Blink Dagger's damage cooldown is 3 seconds. Cast a Shadow Poison while a target is Disrupted to keep their Blink Dagger on cooldown. You don't even need to use the Detonate because the impact damage from the Shadow Poison will disable Blink Dagger and then they'll immediately take damage from the illusions afterwards.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Poison is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost. For maximum supportage, angle yourself so you can stack two camps with one Shadow Poison. Just hope that you don't get Mud Golems.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Poison is another great spell to draw creep aggro off a tower during defenses.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Poison's projectile gives flying vision as it travels.
</li></p><li><p>Demonic Purge is essentially a Diffusal Blade purge that can go through spell immunity. This includes the ability to remove runes. However, this does <i>not</i> include the ability to instagib Warlock's Golem. That's still reserved exclusively for the Diffy Blade.
</li></p><li><p>Demonic Purge can damage and slow enemy couriers.
</li></p><li><p>Agh upgraded Demonic Purge disables passive abilities (like how Doom does).
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Get a Magic Stick if he's spamming Shadow Poison.
</li></p><li><p>The only reason Shadow Poison is balanced is because the projectile is very easy to dodge. Don't get lazy. You won't see a fat 4 above your head, but you can look in your status bar to see how many stacks are on you. If you've bumbled your way into 3 stacks, back off.
</li></p><li><p>The only reason Soul Catcher is balanced is because it's extremely hard to land, especially in the laning phase. Being a ranged hero will actually work against you when laning against SD because your natural positioning makes you easy pickings for a Soul Catchin'.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Cancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.
</li></p><li><p>If you're having a hard time in lane, go stack the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls. This is more viable on Radiant than Dire.
</li></p><li><p>One of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching for since he can make use of all three attributes and frequently gets a bottle.
</li></p><li><p>Almost the entire Requiem of Souls cast animation is hidden by Shadow Blade invisibility.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>The reason this guy isn't picked up in pro games frequently is because Smoke of Deceit exists. Nearly every currently strong mid possesses some sort of escape ability to deal with this. Shadow Fiend is not one of them. Destroying SF's laning phase is the textbook example of "shutting down" a hero.
</li></p><li><p>Don't forget that he mini-ults when he di--too late, you ate it.

<ul><li><p>Ether Shock can hit secondary units ~400 units further away than its cast range. If an enemy is making a run for it and is just out of cast range, cast the Shock on the ranged creep right behind them.
</li></p><li><p>The facts on Hex: Instant cast time, insta-kills illusions, and is super annoying. Spam cast and cancel this spell on the enemy team's initiator when you're toeing off. The moment they blink in and are in range, they'll be Rhasta Fried Chicken.
</li></p><li><p>As cute as it is to spawn your Serpents in a circle around a tower singing kumbaya, you never want to do this. Your wards hurt, but only when they're all able to attack at the same time. When you spawn them in a huge circle, even a Pugna can take them on one by one.
</li></p><li><p>The Serpent Wards are controllable units. This hero is one of the few 'micro' heroes that box selection is encouraged on. Square your Serpents (or double click one, that'll select them all), tell them to stop spitting on creeps, and reorient them on the tower that you were trying to kill or on that 1HP armlet-toggling Naix that inadvertently limped back into your wards' range.
</li></p><li><p>There is no secret to landing Ward Traps other than practice. It's a skillshot, just learn the cast animation and range.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're ward trapped, you can Phase through the serpents using Phase Boots or certain invis/windwalk abilities.
</li></p><li><p>Mass Serpent Ward costs a ton of mana, making Rhasta a great candidate for Mana Burning/Leaking or picking Pugna against.
</li></p><li><p>You can break these cuffs. Always have a stun/silence ready on your team to bail a teammate out from the Shackle channel. At level 4, Shackles disable for nearly as long as Bane's ultimate.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="77"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/silencer_full.png" alt="Silencer"></span><span id=name>Silencer</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Curse of the Silent is great against certain (mainly STR and AGI) heroes. Check your lane and see if it's worth skilling. Even if the heroes do have marginally-spammable spells, you're still forcing the enemy to use them and waste mana when they don't want to. That Venomancer may have Plague Wards, but make him cast them twice and he won't have the juice to Gale you for a while.
</li></p><li><p>Last Word provides a ton of utility all game long. Early game you want to cast it on squishy targets to force them back to the fountain, late game you want to cast it on heroes who rely on spell combos (Invoker, Sand King, Magnus, etc) or carry heroes with few spells (Spectre, Viper, Drow, etc) or ones that blow whatever spells they have the second the fight starts (Sven, Tiny, Ursa, etc). The goal is to either disrupt their spell combo or disarm them. Either way, it's super annoying.
</li></p><li><p>Much like with Undying's Tombstone, you don't want to use Global Silence and then have the enemy team tip their fedoras and walk away until the spell wears off. And much like with Black Hole, you want to save this ult for a full on burly brawl in the mid/late game, not a one-for-one pick off. Silencer's job is rarely to start fights, he's there to SILESILESILENCSILENCSILENCSILSILSSILSILENCE fights that are on the cusp of breaking out. You usually want to cast Global Silence soon after your initiator goes in. It's okay to let a spell or two leak through at the beginning if it means that the enemy is committing to the fight, because the goal is to hit them with the 4'33" right when they're at the point-of-no-return in the team fight.
</li></p><li><p>You can save Global to break channeling ults as well (Enigma, Bane, Sand King, Witch Doctor, CM), but often times it's better to stop them from using their spells altogether by preemptively Silencing than to risk getting disabled while they're channeling.
</li></p><li><p>If you're past the phase when huge 5v5 team fights are being decided by a single ultimate, save your ult until after BKBs get popped. If you Global Silence while an enemy is spell immune, they'll get silenced. If you do it before, they can purge the silence by going spell immune.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Silencer doesn't just temporarily take your INT, he steals it. Avoid trading 1 for 1 with this hero because the INT steal adds up quickly.
</li></p><li><p>Save your BKB for after Global Silence is cast. If Global is cast while you're spell immune, you'll still get silenced. If you go spell immune while you're deaf, the debuff is removed.
</li></p><li><p>Eul's is another cheap but effective way of purging off Global Silence. Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves can also purge it off.

<ul><li><p>Arcane Bolt gives vision as it travels. This is useful in mid matchups as you can use the brief vision before impact to get in one auto-attack if the enemy is on the high ground.
</li></p><li><p>Concussive Shot has zero cast time. If you have the mana, always cast it if you're getting chased.
</li></p><li><p>Ancient Seal is the only single-targeted instant-Silence in the game besides Orchid's active. The magic amplification is nice and all, but a guaranteed 6 second Silence is what makes this skill amazing. Cast+cancel this constantly on initiators before a team fight so you can instantly silence them when they try blinking into your team.
</li></p><li><p>If you are free-balling a Mystic Flare, prediction and practice are your best bets to landing it consistently. You want the enemy to walk into the middle of the Flare half a second after you cast and then think to themselves "Well, great, now it doesn't matter which direction I walk, I'm eating this ult."
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Avoid trying to outrun Arcane Bolt unless you have some plan to not die to it. It's going to hit you regardless, all you're doing is giving the enemy team a tiny little ward that's giving away your location as you run.
</li></p><li><p>If Skywrath is spamming Arcane Bolt, get a Magic Stick. Just be aware that the Stick only gets charges if you have vision on the hero when they cast a spell.
</li></p><li><p>After Skywrath blows his mana load at level 1 with a thousand Arcane Bolts, he'll probably start sipping clarities in the corner like a junkie. Don't let him.
</li></p><li><p>Concussive Shot has a small AoE on impact. Like against Sven's Storm Hammer, avoid clumping up if a Concussive Shot is on your tail.
</li></p><li><p>Beware of the Mystic Flare combos on the enemy team. Sprout/Power Cogs may be annoying spells, but they become killboxes with a Skywrath. If this is a concern, get a Force Staff or Eul's.
</li></p><li><p>BKB completely shuts this hero down. Like, massively. Some INT heroes get pretty shut down with spell immunity, but Skywrath is on a whole 'nother level.
</li></p><li><p>Pugna can be a real pain for Skywrath because all of his spells cost a ton of mana and Nether Ward hurts.

<ul><li><p>You can cast Sprint while TPing and it won't break the channel.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid Sprinting during fights. You usually want to use Sprint either <i>to get to</i> a fight or when you're chasing someone down. 15% bonus damage isn't that dramatic, but every little bit counts.
</li></p><li><p>Slithereen Crush and Bash procs deal physical damage, making them work very well with Amplify Damage's armor reduction.
</li></p><li><p>Cancel Crush's animation. You can usually tell when you're not going to land it.
</li></p><li><p>Amplify Damage can be cast on siege creeps to help quickly bring them down during a push.
</li></p><li><p>Amplify Damage lets your team take Rosh extremely early in the game. Just make sure someone else on your team has a targeted spell to take off Rosh's Linken's first.
</li></p><li><p>People seem to think Slardar's main purpose in the game is: "Oh no, the enemy randomed Riki. I KNOW, I'LL COUNTER PICK HIM WITH SLARDAR." The True Sight on Amplify Damage is just the icing on this amazing skill's cake. Slardar's main role is to be an initiator who can start fights, wedgie the enemy carry, stuff their supports in a locker, then steal Rosh's lunch money.
</li></p><li><p>However, if you are picking him for countering invis heroes get a gem. Amplify Damage isn't some sort of get-out-of-buying-detection-free card. The way to counter invis heroes is to know where they are before they know you know where they are.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Juke left or right if Slardar is chasing you and trying to Crush your Slithereen. The AoE on the stun is tiny and the cast animation is lengthy.
</li></p><li><p>Amplify Damage allows the enemy team to take Roshan super early. Keep the pit warded up tight.
</li></p><li><p>Like with Dust or Track, Amplify Damage can be purged off by Diffusal Blade, Manta Style, or Slark's Dark Pact.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="80"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/slark_full.png" alt="Slark"></span><span id=name>Slark</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Dark Pact is a 'nuke' like Lifestealer's Infest can be a 'nuke.' Yes, the spell can deal healthy damage, but that's not its primary purpose. Don't yank the Pact ripcord the second you get in melee range of your gank target. Wait for them to turn around, or for their teammate to come in to save them, then pull the trigger and wipe off any potential disable. If you need to use Dark Pact for damage, only use it if you're sure the enemy can't stop you or try to save it for the killing blow.
</li></p><li><p><a href ="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel#List_of_abilities_that_cannot_be_dispelled_by_strong_dispels">Dark Pact can't purge a lot of things.</a> The ones worth remembering from this list are Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Bloodseeker's Rupture, Bane's Enfeeble, Witch Doctor's Maledict, Razor's Static Link, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike, or Warlock's Fatal Bonds or Shadow Word.
</li></p><li><p>Medallion is a cute pickup on Slark because Dark Pact can purge the negative armor debuff off yourself after you cast it on an enemy.
</li></p><li><p>Pounce won't latch illusions, making it useful for identifying the real CK/PL/Waifu Siren.
</li></p><li><p>Pounce can hit invisible units.
</li></p><li><p>Pounce disjoints stuff like tower shots or ranged right clicks. If you time it right you can even evade projectile spells like Assassinate.
</li></p><li><p>Take advantage of your collisionless state in Pounce when you're escaping. Don't just leap along down the lane, jump over a tree line or clear a cliff to create a gap.
</li></p><li><p>Essence Shift gifts you with a bonus 19 'pure damage' (with the STR removal), 13 'mana burn' (with the INT removal), and sucks off 1 damage from the enemy (with their primary attribute's removal).
</li></p><li><p>Capitalize on Essence Shift stacks. Don't sit around and farm after you get a kill, take a tower or TP to another lane and use all the damage you have to continue snowballing.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Dance is an extremely effective spell for counterwarding. The moment you stop dripping and slow down, you're in enemy vision and the Shadow Dance passive is lost.
</li></p><li><p>Slark is one of few heroes that has 1800 night vision.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Dark Pact purges as often as it damages, meaning that there are 10 little mini-purges throughout the duration of the spell. So don't stun Slark mid-Pact.
</li></p><li><p>Ground targeted spells (especially stuns like LSA, Split Earth, Impale, etc.) are highly valuable against Slark for hassling him whenever he activates Shadow Dance.
</li></p><li><p>Inexperienced Slarks have a tendency of going for long-range Pounces which are fairly easy to juke. Line yourself up with him when you're getting chased to tease the Pounce out, then move straight left or right and dodge it.
</li></p><li><p>Try to block Pounce by standing in front of Slark if he's trying to escape.
</li></p><li><p>Essence Shift is the long con. You may think you're winning these exchanges in lane because Slark has awful HP, but he's gaining a Slipper of Agility and you're losing an Iron Branch's worth of stats every time you trade hits.
</li></p><li><p>You'll get your Essence Shifted stats back when you respawn, but Slark will still have them as well. If Slark dies, you'll still be missing your stats, but he'll lose them as well.
</li></p><li><p>Ghost Scepter isn't as useful against Slark as it is against some other gankers since Pounce and Pact can deal substantial magical damage, but it can still be a worthwhile pickup.
</li></p><li><p>He has no means of breaking channels. If Slark is hot on your tail, just start TPing.
</li></p><li><p>Bloodseeker notably counters the dickens out of Slark. Slark doesn't like to be silenced, he can't Dark Pact off Rupture, and if he loses too much HP he'll make BS Thirsty and give him true sight, stopping him from getting Shadow Dance regen.

<div id="81"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/sniper_full.png" alt="Sniper"></span><span id=name>Sniper</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Starting from level 2 of Take Aim, you can hit towers without them hitting you. Use it in conjunction with the vision that Shrapnel gives you for easy night sieges.
</li></p><li><p>You can cancel Assassinations with the Stop key.
</li></p><li><p>With no additional magic resistance (like from Cloak, Spell Shield, or being Meepo), Assassination deals ~240/365/487 raw damage. Avoid discharging impotent Assassinations. Sniper doesn't have a lot of mana and you need every second you can get in lane farming, rather than sitting in the fountain complaining about how someone didn't die to your ult.
</li></p><li><p>The hero that needs to exploit positioning in lane the most. The Sniper Shuffle is the complex laning dance that involves waddling forward, popping the enemy in the face until you get a Headshot, pissing them off, running backwards, praying that they don't feel like wasting the energy to kill you, and waiting for them to retreat. Then repeat. The better you are at predicting enemy movement, the better Sniper you can be.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If you're getting Assassinated, you will have an icon in your buffs. The shot will get fired when the buff timer goes around halfway. It can't be disjointed by traditional invisibility (only Smoke of Deceit), but if you're quick you can dodge it once the projectile is about to hit you with spells like Rage, Disruption, or Leap or items like BKB, Eul's, or even Blink Dagger.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="82"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/spectre_full.png" alt="Spectre"></span><span id=name>Spectre</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>The collisionless grace period on Spectral Dagger is pretty generous. Even if you toss the Dagger one way and walk in the opposite way, you still get ~2 seconds of collisonless phasing. So if you don't need to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape down a cliff or across some trees in the other direction.
</li></p><li><p>Spectral Dagger's slow goes through spell immunity.
</li></p><li><p>Desolate never misses. It goes through both blinds and evasion.
</li></p><li><p>Dispersion reflects damage that you would have taken. Therefore, every time you die from max health, 28.2% of your HP pool is reflected as AoE pure damage (it's more than the 22% due to the increased EHP that Dispersion gives you). This means that the only way to buff Dispersion damage is to increase your HP pool, not by building armor or other damage mitigation.
</li></p><li><p>If you have 2 lives (buyback, Aegis) save Haunt for your second one. Dispersion from your first death will leave the enemy team low, allowing your Haunts to do clean up work.
</li></p><li><p>Spectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Haunt allows her to perpetually farm lanes or split push because she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.
</li></p><li><p>Haunt illusions start with a 400 base move speed, which means not only do they have an easy time sticking to their target, but +% move speed items like Yasha or Drums are even more effective on them.
</li></p><li><p>You can use Reality multiple times during a Haunt cast. You swap positions with each illusion that you Reality to, so it can be useful for picking up a kill on a retreating hero and then warping back into the fight or back to lane.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Spectre might as well be holding a pool noodle as a weapon for the first 15 minutes of the game. Spectral Dagger is way too expensive to offensively spam, Desolate nearly irrelevant in lane because she's too slow to consistently harass and there are creeps everywhere, and Dispersion's payoff is low when her HP pool is mediocre and the damage being dealt isn't high. If you shut her down early, her lack of a farming skill to fall back on will gimp the enemy team big time.
</li></p><li><p>Haunt illusions can be slowed and hexes will instantly kill them, but they can't be stunned, body blocked, juked, or otherwise prevented from rubbing themselves all over squishy supports.
</li></p><li><p>Whenever she Haunts, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to mid game her only Haunt damage is coming from Desolate, so don't let it proc.
</li></p><li><p>Spec doesn't do much damage to Roshan, she's bad at taking towers, and she has pretty miserable AGI gain for a carry. This means that when you lose a team fight, Spec's team won't be able to take too many objectives.
</li></p><li><p>Spell immunity ignores damage from Desolate and Dispersion, making BKB a solid pickup against Spec.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="83"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/spirit_breaker_full.png" alt="Spirit Breaker"></span><span id=name>Spirit Breaker</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>You can use items while you're Charging, like Shadow Blade, Mask of Madness, or BKB. You can even TP while you're charging, but only to the fountain and only if you double click the TP.
</li></p><li><p>You can also tread swap while Charging. So switch to INT treads before casting and turn back to STR treads while you're charging.
</li></p><li><p>Empowering Haste is a useful active spell. Please don't forget to use it.
</li></p><li><p>If you're getting ganked and you can't take the fight, immediately move your camera over to another lane, find a creep or neutral, and Charge it. This is your escape mechanism.
</li></p><li><p>Greater Bash is essentially a crit dressed up in a scaling bash. Unfortunately, the only way of amplifying the 'crit' damage is by building move speed, not damage. The plus side is that you have two guaranteed ways of proccing this crit Bash with Charge and Nether Strike. At 522 move speed, which can be reached fairly easily with Treads+Drum+max Empowering Haste+an active Mask of Madness, a level 4 Greater Bash deals ~209 magical damage. This would make the Charge+Nether Strike combo deal ~667 magical damage at level 11.
</li></p><li><p>You can Nether Strike the enemy courier. It won't deal any damage, but you will bash it.
</li></p><li><p>Probably the best Dust carrier and anti-invis hero you could ask for in pubs. Every time Dust is off cooldown, Charge that Riki and bash him into next Tuesday.
</li></p><li><p>Get wards in the enemy jungle. Players will automatically avoid farming in lane once they realize you're becoming a threat and will start farming their jungle. Teach them that there is no sanctuary from the space cow.
</li></p><li><p>SB is the tankiest level 1 hero in the game. With no items, the cosmic bull has an EHP of ~927. Take advantage of your chuftiness and don't be afraid of getting into fights early on.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Ward everywhere. You need to always be keeping tabs on Spirit Breaker: Where does he come from, where does he go, who is he ganking, Barathrum Joe.
</li></p><li><p>Charge can break Linken's from across the map. In bronze scum pubs this makes Linken's an SB counter, but in RIAA-certified Double Platinum tier, this makes SB a Linken's counter.
</li></p><li><p>One of the easiest heroes to bait. No SB can resist charging down a lonely CM quietly farming in lane, so take advantage of the mad cow's blood thirst. After a few failed ganks, the map will open up substantially when he stops Charging on a whim.
</li></p><li><p>You can stun SB while he's charging. This is useful to know when you're getting Charged, but it's also useful when you're ganking SB. Keep a stun in your pocket for when he tries to Charge to another lane.
</li></p><li><p>You can disable SB while he's in the middle of the cast animation for Nether Strike.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="84"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/storm_spirit_full.png" alt="Storm Spirit"></span><span id=name>Storm Spirit</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Static Remnants give you flying vision in a fairly large radius around their cast point. Use this to find people trying to juke in the trees, scout Rosh, or check an area before going up hill.
</li></p><li><p>Remnants last 12 seconds each so it's not a bad idea to set some up if you're afraid a Nyx or Bounty is trailing you since they'll detonate and damage on invis units.
</li></p><li><p>Only Electric Vortex levels 3 and 4 will pull a target far enough into a Remnant that you create after you Vortex. Levels 1 and 2 will just wiggle them down a bit while you waste mana and slow yourself down.
</li></p><li><p>You can Overload an auto attack while it's in the air. If you just tossed a long range auto attack on a target, you can cast a Remnant or Ball real quick and the attack will hit Overloaded.
</li></p><li><p>Cast a spell in the fountain or throw up a quick Remnant once you reach your destination if you're going to be TPing to a tower. Or use a spell before activating an invis rune. Get your free Overload.
</li></p><li><p>You can use items while in Ball Lightning, like Orchid. You can begin channeling a TP while flying. You can cast spells like Remnant or Electric Vortex while flying. You can even pick up runes that are along your path while in Ball Lightning.
</li></p><li><p>Storm will immediately perform the next action you ordered once you come out of Ball Lightning (if you have auto-attack after spell enabled in your settings). If there is no action (like a right click on the enemy hero), he'll just auto attack the nearest thing. This can be irritating when you're Balling long distances or into fogged vision because he'll inevitably blow an Overload charge on a creep. To avoid this, hit the stop key while you're flying and he'll do nothing when he lands.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid making multiple short trips when you're escaping and Balling on a mana budget. Do one long trip. There's no reason to have to pay the ignition cost of Ball Lightning multiple times if you have one destination.
</li></p><li><p>You are completely invincible while in Ball Lightning, so brush up on your jukenomics. Besides using the invincibility to dodge things, spells like Mana Leak or Rupture won't affect you when you're traveling and you can even fly through a Chronosphere without getting locked.
</li></p><li><p>A lot of people shoehorn themselves into always building mana regeneration on Storm. It's okay to build yourself around mana optimization, rather than regeneration, if that's your playstyle. Boots of Travel can be a good pickup since TPing to a creep can halve the Ball distance to an enemy instead of TPing to a tower. BKB allows you to stand in a fight and lets you use Ball Lightning exclusively to get Overload charges. Even Shadow Blade, while clowny, can allow you to initiate with a straight Backstab -> Vortex, letting you keep Ball mana in the bank for when you need to escape or chase enemies down.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Shut his mouth. Silences and basically every disable really rumble Storm's jonathans. The more time he has to spend walking around with Underloaded right clicking, the less happy he is.
</li></p><li><p>Break his ankles. Like most other heroes with a blink, Storms will overshoot Ball Lightning down the path that they think you're traveling so they can get in more right clicks. If you're escaping out of his auto attack range during a gank, as soon as he starts Balling towards you, turn around and move to where he just was. He'll either have to Ball again or slowly walk to come back.
</li></p><li><p>Ghost Scepter is an underrated item against Storm. Yes, most of his damage is magic, but he actually has to right click on you to deal it.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="85"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/sven_full.png" alt="Sven"></span><span id=name>Sven</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Storm Hammer is arguably the best level one stun in the game. The caveat is that you'll only have the mana for one stun every five minutes because of how mana hungry the spell is and how terrible Sven's INT gain is. Pretty much every time you drop the Hammer during the laning phase, it needs to end up in a kill.
</li></p><li><p>Warcry is a very potent pushing skill. The armor buff applies to all allied units in the AoE, including summons. Even if you're not pushing, you can use it on your creep wave as it passes the river to get some extra tower damage or to make it harder for the enemy to last hit.
</li></p><li><p>Warcry is a very potent chasing skill. The 12% move speed buff is almost another pair of brown Boots' worth of MS. Take a level of this early on.
</li></p><li><p>Warcry is a very potent team fighting skill. When maxed, you're giving an Assault Cuirass's's's worth of armor to everyone on your team for 7 seconds.
</li></p><li><p>God's Strength multiples Sven's primary attribute damage. Meaning, when you go full WOLOLO, your STR is getting multiplied, but items that are adding green + damage (raw damage items) aren't get multiplied.
</li></p><li><p>Sven is the only hero on whom BKB is truly <i>core</i> core. On nearly every other hero, BKB is primarily bought a defensive item, but because God's Strength jacks Sven up from his STR, BKB is a ridiculously strong offensive item on him, giving +44/49/54 damage at 6/11/16. This is the same reason why Heart is actually a very strong damage item on Sven (+80/100/120 dmg).
</li></p><li><p>BKB is also necessary to serve as the can opener for the whoop ass you deliver with God's Strength. Time spent disabled is time spent not smashing everything in your path.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>You can disjoint Storm Hammer. If the primary target of the stun disjoints it, nothing in the AoE will get stunned.
</li></p><li><p>Sven relies on being able to kill you before you kill him. He's a STR hero, but he's often built like a plexiglass cannon. In team fights, he should pretty much always be the top priority if he's the carry.

<ul><li><p>The bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get dropped on denial attacks. This is relevant for mid lane controlling purposes, because you can aggressively deny your creeps and push the lane at the same time with the spill.
</li></p><li><p>All damage sources are created equal on the temple steps. Whether it's a ranged creep, a tower shot, or a Laguna Blade, every instance of damage you take will wipe a Refraction charge off. As a TA, it's massively important to learn how to maintain creep aggro to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction charges.
</li></p><li><p>The cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.
</li></p><li><p>Meld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a split-second of fog.
</li></p><li><p>You have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.
</li></p><li><p>For a good laugh, buy a Shadow Blade and cast Meld during the fade time. Then walk away a second later and watch the enemy team angrily attack the ground.
</li></p><li><p>If you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using A+left click instead of right clicking on the enemy.
</li></p><li><p>Meld damage does not spill. So stop wasting mana Melding the front creep in a wave.
</li></p><li><p>The armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh.
</li></p><li><p>To be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi-Blades like a violin. Each deny should effortlessly pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect spills.
</li></p><li><p>Always go for denies. The Psi-Blade will spill even if the creep dies before your attack projectile hits.
</li></p><li><p>You can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps themselves. However, please notify your teammates that you're doing this otherwise you're going to sabotage their micro.
</li></p><li><p>The core Trap locations are the runes (or one rune), their side of the hill, your side of the hill, Rosh, and choke points on stairs. The rest is dealer's choice.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>If TA is receiving the damage buff from Refraction, her Psi-Blades will be longer and glow redder. Personally, I can't tell the difference and I don't have the time to color match it at Home Depot when I'm dying under my tower, but it's true.
</li></p><li><p>DoT her Refraction. Venomancer, Viper, Radiance, etc. Spells that deal lots of instances of damage like Dark Pact, Torrent, Soul Rip (yes, Soul Rip deals one instance of damage per unit), or Rot are good too.
</li></p><li><p>Urn of Shadows can also break TA's Refraction, but it only ticks once every ~0.5s, so it's not very effective.
</li></p><li><p>You can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration buff (which is purgable), not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted or non-targeted spells otherwise she'll just sit there until her Blink comes off cooldown.
</li></p><li><p>However, spells that change her position like Flamebreak, Blinding Light, Power Cogs, Gust, or Fissure, can break Meld.
</li></p><li><p>Know what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?
</li></p><li><p>Always be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy trying to position spill on you.
</li></p><li><p>If you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 6 minutes. Not only will this allow you to actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that you know she has on your side of the hill.
</li></p><li><p>Smokes are great against TA because teams will often be lazy with warding when they can rely on Trap vision.

<ul><li><p>Gush's side effect is armor reduction. Try to use it before Anchor Smash since Anchor Smash is physical damage.
</li></p><li><p>Since Anchor Smash deals physical damage, you can use it to kill ancient creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Anchor Smash is an extremely easy spell to animation cancel (hit the stop key). This is mainly relevant if you're laning against another melee hero since you can bait them out of getting last hits by throwing out half-Smashes.
</li></p><li><p>The damage reduction on Anchor Smash can be applied through spell immunity. Meaning that if you're dealing with BKB carries, save your post-Ravage Anchor Smash after BKBs are turned on. If you apply it before they go spell immune, BKB will purge the debuff off.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Ravage has a travel time as it expands outward, so if you're quick, you can attempt Force Staffing or using some other repositioning spell/item to evade it.

<ul><li><p>Whirling Death can be activated while you're mid-Timber Chain.
</li></p><li><p>Remember that Whirling Death only deals pure damage if it cuts a tree down during the cast.
</li></p><li><p>Be generous when targeting Timber Chain. It's okay to sacrifice ~50 range to ensure you aren't airballing chains.
</li></p><li><p>Your goal in lane is to find the minimum amount of creep aggro you need to draw to keep Reactive Armor working at its cap.
</li></p><li><p>An enemy can receive the burst damage from the Chakram once when it flies out and once when it's coming back. So if it looks like an enemy is about to escape the AoE of the Chakram, just return it while they're still in it. The extra passthrough damage will be more useful than a few more milliseconds of slow.
</li></p><li><p>Learn the trees on the map. There are many unique juke paths that only Timber can take advantage of thanks to his skill set.
</li></p><li><p>When escaping late game, try carving out paths with Chakram before Timber Chaining. Timber Chaining into a deforested area could buy you a few seconds of fog.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't stand next to trees when laning against or escaping from Timber. The distance you're saving by hugging the treeline won't matter when he purely damages your ass.
</li></p><li><p>Timbersaw hates being silenced, especially if he has a Chakram out because that means he literally can't do anything.
</li></p><li><p>Chakram has a fairly slow travel time, so it's usually worth sacrificing some positioning if it means you can evade the slow when he's chasing you.
</li></p><li><p>You can disable Timbersaw mid-Chain to stop him from moving.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid right click harassing him in lane. That's what he wants. Save your mana and HP for a full kill attempt or just harass him with magic damage.
</li></p><li><p>If you're a strength hero, Whirling Death's primary attribute loss debuff will eat you for breakfast. Most STR heroes have ~35 strength at level 4 with no items, meaning that you'll lose ~100 HP in addition to the nuke damage.

<div id="90"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/tinker_full.png" alt="Tinker"></span><span id=name>Tinker</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Laser does pure damage. On Tinker, one of the most obvious ways to take advantage of this is to ignore heroes with increased magic resistance (Huskar, Anti-Mage, Meepo, etc) or heroes with Cloak/Hood.
</li></p><li><p>Laser's 100% Blind is a big deal. Early game, you can keep it in your pocket for when a right click hero dives you. Late game, it's effectively a three-second Halberd disarm.
</li></p><li><p>You want to cast March of the Machines diagonally to the creep wave to ensure that the little machines have the highest probability of colliding with creeps.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid drying yourself out every time you TP on the lane in the late game. Keep mana in the bank to deal with a Rearm or TP getting broken. At the very least, keep your Soul Ring off CD whenever you're Traveling back to the fountain.
</li></p><li><p>You don't have to level Rearm at 6. If you're getting slow farm and aren't close to your Boots of Travel, you'll be better off leveling spells that can net you kills.
</li></p><li><p>Remember to shift+queue your blink dagger while you're TPing to a creep. That split second of targeting your blink after you teleport in could get you killed.
</li></p><li><p>Every single minute mark is valuable for Tinker, especially if/when you get a Blink Dagger. Tinker can take advantage of stacking like a mother. Time your TPs so you can end up near jungle camps at the :53 second mark, then March the stack down.
</li></p><li><p>Using Soul Ring will always give you a +150 mana buffer, even if your mana is filled. So don't use Soul Ring before you TP out of the fountain otherwise the TP will take mana out of the buffer.
</li></p><li><p>Take advantage of the few seconds of residual Fountain Aura when you TP to a creep. If you're fast, you should be able to use a Bottle charge and have it replenished immediately, and you should be able to lose minimal HP from Soul Ring's Sacrifice.
</li></p><li><p>Don't make life hard for the carry. You have the ability to be in all three lanes whenever you want, but you also have the ability to bail at a moment's notice. Much like Nature's Prophet, Tinker's job is to farm the dangerous locations that other heroes can't. So stay out of the lane that your carry is trying to farm.
</li></p><li><p>Use fake TPs to scare enemies off chasing your allies even when you don't want to commit.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>For some reason, lane creeps drop aggro off of an enemy creep if there is a Boots of Traveled person TPing onto it. So it's up to you to kill the creep and prevent Tinker's TP.
</li></p><li><p>Boots of Travel's channel time does not increase based on nearby teammate TPs like scrolls do, meaning that backup from Tinker can come quickly.
</li></p><li><p>Tinker is a filthy liar. Heat-Seeking Missiles miss. A lot. Ways to make them miss include: Any kind of blinking, any kind of invisibling (including Smoke), any kind of banishing, any kind of teleporting, any kind of spell immunity, and spells like Pounce, Leap, Waveform, etc. This spell gets more disjointed than an old lady falling down the stairs, which begs the question as to why Tinker hypes their reliability.
</li></p><li><p>Pugna's Nether Ward can make life exceptionally hard for Tinker.
</li></p><li><p>Clockwerk is also a fairly good counter since he can get vision of Tinker in the trees with Flare and initiate on him from a large distance.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Avalanche has a short delay before the stun connects, so try to slightly lead it if you can. You don't need to go full Leshrac, but you're not going to hit someone who's running from the outskirts of the AoE.
</li></p><li><p>Avalanche is constantly stunning in the AoE, so you can throw it in advance, like Ice Path, if you know a hero will be in the AoE before it finishes (mid-banish, pre-TP).
</li></p><li><p>Toss damages buildings if a unit lands on it.
</li></p><li><p>Toss breaks channels through spell immunity, including your allies'. Don't Toss your Sandy Claws until he finishes channeling Epicenter.
</li></p><li><p>You can Toss people to runes.
</li></p><li><p>Let your right clicks finish. Tiny's attack speed is constantly changing throughout the course of the game, which makes it a real pain to consistently cancel his backswing animation. Err on the side of caution and be patient. 
</li></p><li><p>You want to cast Toss slightly after Avalanche connects to get the full combo damage.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>As long as the rocks are flying around, an Avalanche will stun you if you walk into the AoE.
</li></p><li><p>Craggy Exterior will make you froth at the mouth if you're a melee carry, so get a BKB.
</li></p><li><p>Tiny has no armor to start. Coupled with his super slow attack animation, Tiny can't trade hits very well in lane.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="92"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/treant_full.png" alt="Treant Protector"></span><span id=name>Treant Protector</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Treant can use items while he's Nature's Guise'd. This is useful for stealthily planting wards in enemy territory or for using a TP while invis and arriving to your destination still invis.
</li></p><li><p>You still have collision when Guise'd, so you will block paths and bump into heroes.
</li></p><li><p>During pushes, save Leech Seed for when the creep waves clash under a tower so your creeps won't run away from the heal.
</li></p><li><p>The two aspects of Living Armor (the heal and the block) are not separate buffs like with TA's Refraction. If you take too many damage instances, you will lose the heal. Assume that all your allies are idiots and don't understand how 'damage instances' work and avoid healing teammates when they're aggro'd by a bunch of creeps or neutrals.
</li></p><li><p>Avoid casting Living Armor on a tower unless you know that the enemy creep wave is far away for the same reason.
</li></p><li><p>If you use Living Armor on a tower while it's Glyphed, the damage instances won't tick down.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Living Armor and Nature's Guise on the courier.
</li></p><li><p>There are always occasions when you can be using Living Armor. In the early game, be policing your lanes if anyone needs the heal. If no one needs the heal, then see if someone can benefit from the block. If no heroes need it, then look at towers. In the late game, when you're struggling for relevance, you can always cast it on creeps to ever so slowly help a push.
</li></p><li><p>Since everyone knows to not BKB until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken with enemy carries. You can cancel the Overgrowth cast against dumber enemies, but most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>It's usually not worth buying Dust just for Nature's Guise in most games, but it is a good idea to keep a sentry in the vicinity when your team is pushing an enemy tower to protect against Treant surprise Overgrowthing your team.
</li></p><li><p>Nature's Guise is purgable.
</li></p><li><p>You can see the Living Armor buff on enemy heroes if you click on them to check the number of block instances left and the amount of time left.
</li></p><li><p>DoT spells are good at burning off Living Armor since each damage tick will take off one block instance.
</li></p><li><p>The Living Armor damage block makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit, so avoid early game aggression.
</li></p><li><p>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant, you have to commit fully to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time.
</li></p><li><p>If Treant is solo laning, consider aggressively pushing as soon as possible. It may seem counterintuitive, but if Tree has to blow Armor on healing his tower, that means he's not using it to help his teammates.
</li></p><li><p>Cast BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or Diffusal Purge AFTER you're Overgrowth'd to break out of it.
</li></p><li><p>You can manually cast orbs to attack while Overgrowth'd.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="93"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/troll_warlord_full.png" alt="Troll Warlord"></span><span id=name>Troll Warlord</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Every attribute is harder, better, faster, and stronger in melee form. Typically the only reasons you should be in ranged form after the laning phase is to cast the Whirling Axes slow, get hits on an enemy if you're blocked out by Fissure or Cogs or something, or get one very last hit on an enemy before they escape.
</li></p><li><p>When healing, try to stay in ranged form. It's not much, but you have 100 extra HP when in melee form, meaning you'll heal a smaller percentage of your health in melee form.
</li></p><li><p>Troll is tied with PA as the dumbest hero in the game with +1 INT growth per level. Whirling Axes (Melee) is a great wave clearing spell, but Troll runs out of magic juice fast, especially if you got a Shadow Blade or other mana-requiring items, so be careful about spamming and don't build % mana-regen items.
</li></p><li><p>Neither the blind, nor the damage, from Whirling Axes (Melee) work on Rosh.
</li></p><li><p>Whirling Axes (Ranged) give a dope amount of lingering flying vision over the AoE.
</li></p><li><p>Pay attention to when you can help your team with Battle Trance if you're not around.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Troll's no Ursa, but he can still solo Rosh fairly early in the game. Keep your eyes on the pit after he picks up some lifesteal.
</li></p><li><p>The blind on Whirling Axes (Melee) is obnoxious and usually worth getting a King Bar for. It also means that you need to be very careful when ganking him if you don't have a lot of magic burst.
</li></p><li><p>Troll's entire kit revolves around making chop suey out of a single target. If he has to switch focus before killing a target, you're doing a good job dealing with him. Force Staffs, Eulses, and Banishes are all ideal counters.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<ul><li><p>Ice Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.
</li></p><li><p>Ice Shards provides vision for 2 seconds.
</li></p><li><p>You, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable when rolling in a Snowball. This means that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast spells while you're in the Snowball.
</li></p><li><p>You can pick up new heroes while you're rolling mid-Snowball.
</li></p><li><p>Use the Sigil, please. It gives flying vision and it can slow spell immune enemies. Just don't feed it, because it's worth a fair amount of gold.
</li></p><li><p>Walrus Punch breaks channels, even if the enemy is spell immune.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Ice Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.
</li></p><li><p>Tusk and all his allies are invincible in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks apart.
</li></p></ul></div></div>

<div id="95"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/undying_full.png" alt="Undying"></span><span id=name>Undying</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Decay is weird nuke. You take 76 HP (4 STR)+the nuke damage from a hero on every cast, but it doesn't look like much because their HP bar is still full green. After you play Dirge for a couple of games, you realize that enemies will often fail to notice how much HP they're missing in lane and how much damage you've built up. So crank the aggression.
</li></p><li><p>In lane, try to use Decay only when you can catch multiple heroes. The people you are laning against are not drift compatible. Even if they're doing a good job avoiding each other, they'll eventually bumble into each other, which is when you pounce.
</li></p><li><p>Try to use healing items only when you don't have Decay stacks on. Since Decay gives you more STR, you're healing a lower percentage of actual health when you eat a tango.
</li></p><li><p>Soul Rip is technically more useful as a heal than a nuke because healing isn't reduced by magic resistance.
</li></p><li><p>You can Soul Rip your Tombstone to heal it. In 90% of team fights this is how you should be using the spell.
</li></p><li><p>If you're getting ganked, use Soul Rip before spamming Decay. Decay increases your STR, but Soul Rip only heals a flat amount of HP. You'll heal a larger portion of your max HP if you use Soul Rip first and then steal strength.
</li></p><li><p>Zombies add to Soul Rip's unit count.
</li></p><li><p>"Oh good, Flesh Golem is down, let's force a fight," said no team ever. Tombstone is your real ult, so use it carefully. The fight needs to get nice and committed before you should feel comfortable bringing the thriller, so don't initiate with it. The zombie spawning AoE may feel like a lot in the laning phase, but when team fights start rolling around, people will escape the zombie spawn radius without even trying if you plop down the Tombstone on reflex.
</li></p><li><p>If you're trying to use Tombstone as a slow, you're pretty desperate. If you're that desperate, the enemy has probably been running for a while. If the enemy has been running for a while, their teammates are probably en route. If their teammates force a fight, you have no Tombstone. Don't use Tombstone as a last ditch slow. However, it can be useful if you need vision since zombies have 1400 day and night vision for some reason.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't stand next to your lane partner when you're against Undying, especially in a trilane. If he's spamming Decay, make sure he's only hitting one hero.
</li></p><li><p>Because Undying takes your STR in lane, healing items are more effective. If you've got a few stacks of Decay on yourself, that's the best time to use a tango.
</li></p><li><p>Gyro's Flak Cannon and Ember's Sleight of Fist are the only spells capable of committing mass zombie genocide.
</li></p><li><p>Kill the Tombstone. Finish it. I don't want this toss-one-attack-meh-I-didn't-do-much-damage-to-it-so-it's-not-my-problem business, or this well-we-almost-killed-it-but-then-it-got-Soul-Ripped-so-whatevs garbage. Unless your team has one of the aforementioned methods of zombie genocide it is almost ALWAYS worth killing the Tombstone the second it comes up. Even if you're faring okay as the carry, your support players fending for dear life if you don't  help them.
</li></p><li><p>Techies' Land Mines can damage the Tombstone.
</li></p><li><p>Elder Titan's Astral Spirit gets damage and movespeed for every zombie it hits.
</li></p><li><p>Mjollnir is a fairly good pickup against Undying since zombies constantly hitting you will help Static Shield proc more frequently. The lightning(s) won't kill zombies, though.
</li></p><li><p>Crimson Guard effectively neutralizes all zombie damage for 10 seconds.
</li></p><li><p>Zombies will lose interest in you if you go invisible.
</li></p><li><p>Zombies don't break Urn of Shadows healing.
</li></p><li><p>You can see how much time is left on the Tombstone by clicking on it and watching its 'Spell Immunity' buff run down.
</li></p><li><p>Flesh Golem's damage amplification is vastly underestimated. Undying isn't just being a nuisance stomping around your carry, he's being a walking Soul Catcher. You don't have to kill him right off the bat, but keep him off of your high priority allies.

<ul><li><p>Earthshock is ridiculously good slow that gets little respect. Please skill it, it's nearly as good as Brewmaster's clap.
</li></p><li><p>You consume Overpower stacks on denial attacks.
</li></p><li><p>The duration on Overpower is 5 seconds longer than the cooldown. Meaning that before you go in for a gank or into Rosh, you should cast Overpower well in advance so the second cast is already in the chamber when you need it.
</li></p><li><p>When laning, try to keep Fury Swipe stacks up like you would Batrider's Sticky Napalm, especially against melee heroes. Ursa has very high base armor, so he can take abuse quite well.
</li></p><li><p>Ursa has probably the most flexible item options of any AGI carry in the game (yes, he's AGI). Really the only item he <i>'needs'</i> is Vlad's/Morbid Mask, the rest situational. Any pair of boots can work, Blink or Shadow Blade/Silver Edge are good for initiation, Halberd can be great for manfights against bashlords, hell even Sheepstick or Eul's are great if you don't need anything else.
</li></p><li><p>Roshing for Dummies: Get Vlad's (or just a Morbid Mask if you're feeling saucy), get Smoke, cast Smoke, TP to nearest tower, cast Overpower, wait a couple of seconds, run into the Rosh pit, chop Rosh, cast Overpower again immediately, UHHUHAUAHUAH IMMORTALITY.
</li></p><li><p>Take the time to check runes during the laning phase as Ursa. Getting a Haste rune is basically an all expenses paid trip to first blood.
</li></p><li><p>Enrage purges you when you cast it. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or ensnares.
</li></p><li><p>TAKE THE ROSH TIMER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GRIZZLY-ASS, POLAR-ASS, BROWN-ASS, BLACK-ASS, APPARENTLY-GIANT-PANDAS-ARE-ALSO-A-MEMBER-OF-THE-BEAR-FAMILY-ASS HERO.

<ul><li><p>Ursa has no stuns, so keep your finger on the TP when you see him moseying on down towards you.
</li></p><li><p>You really need at least one Force Staff on your team against Ursa, preferably more. After that, Eul's, Sheep, and Ghost Scepter are all good support items against Ursa.
</li></p><li><p>Keep eyes in and on the Rosh pit when you know it's up. If you have a spell that can give you lasting vision inside the pit (Techies mines, TA traps), get one in before his first Rosh.
</li></p><li><p>Good carry items against Ursa are Basher/Abyssal, Manta, Halberd, and sometimes Ethereal Blade.
</li></p><li><p>Ursa can purge himself with Enrage, heroes with unpurgeable abilities like Invoker's Deafening Blast, Viper's Viper Strike, Oracle's Fate's Edict, or Bloodseeker's Rupture quite useful. Enrage also can't purge off the Heaven's Halberd disarm.
</li></p><li><p>You can purge Enrage, making heroes like Shadow Demon or Oracle fairly good against Ursa.
</li></p><li><p>Be wary of Level 1 Rosh attempts when Wraith King, Lone Druid, Vengeful Spirit, or Io are on Ursa's team.

<ul><li><p>Wave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive range+vision.
</li></p><li><p>Wave of Terror affects spell immune units and Roshan. It can also disable clarities and salves.
</li></p><li><p>Vengeance Aura only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not +damage items.
</li></p><li><p>Vlad's can be a worthwhile pickup on VS, because if you're standing around your carry, you'll be giving them +51% bonus damage with both Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura.
</li></p><li><p>Nether Swap goes through spell immunity.
</li></p><li><p>If you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can use Swap to break Black Hole.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Blade can be an amusing pickup on VS, since Swap to Shadow Walk is a pretty safe maneuver in most pubs.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>The Wave of Terror debuff lasts 20 seconds and at level 4, it's basically an AoE Medallion on your whole team.
</li></p><li><p>When you're 20 minutes in on a terrible game and you're trying to make yourself feel better by asking, "Who has the better late game?" The answer is typically the team with VS on it. Vengeance Aura gets stronger as (most) carries get stronger. End soon against a VS before she starts beefing up her carries or turns into one herself.
</li></p><li><p>If you're a support and you got the kill credit on VS during a team fight, that means that you have the negative Vengeance Aura on you. If you're not contributing much to what your team does next (like pushing a tower), stay away from your team.
</li></p><li><p>At level 16, Nether Swap's range is 1200, which is dangerously long. During T3 tower defenses, make sure that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground otherwise your carry is going to get swapped.

<ul><li><p>Veno is a great hero to practice harassing without drawing creep aggro. Poison Sting isn't an orb, but with good aggro control, you can almost have it behave like one.
</li></p><li><p>A lot of people don't like skilling Plague Wards early because they claim it pushes the lane. That would be right, if it weren't completely wrong. LET ME BREAK DOWN SOME XxX360NOSTOPWARDCONTROLxXx.

</li></p><li><p>tl;dw - Use the stop key and use unified unit orders. No one is forcing Plague Wards to constantly attack. Stop them if there are no heroes around, sic them all on a creep at the same time to last hit or deny, put them up on cliffs and tell them to shut up so they don't alert an enemy who didn't know you could see them.
</li></p><li><p>This is also useful when chasing enemies down with Plague Wards. When you throw one up ahead, don't waste time selecting it to acquire a target, just issue a unified ctrl+right click on the enemy hero.
</li></p><li><p>Plague Wards have collision and can be used to block narrow paths.
</li></p><li><p>Try to deny your Plague Wards in lane.
</li></p><li><p>Veno is damn good at harassing junglers. Plague wards block camps, have an awesome cast range, short CD, last forever, and are impossible for enemies to kill quickly enough without blocking a camp themselves. Even beyond that, Poison Sting is really hard to deal with for most junglers.
</li></p><li><p>With one cast of a 4 point Gale and one attack with a 4 point Poison Sting, you do ~850 magical damage over 15 seconds.

<ul><li><p>If you're trading hits frequently in lane, focus your points in Corrosive Skin rather than your orb. Corrosive actually deals more DoT (40/60/80/100) than Poison Attack (20/32/44/56).
</li></p></ul>

<ul><li><p>For the first 25 minutes of the game you're not going to get away from Viper and you're not going to win a manfight against him. Shrug your shoulders, pack your bags up, and start TPing as soon as the first orb hits you.
</li></p><li><p>You want to avoid putting DoTs on Viper. Every time he takes damage, Corrosive Skin will refresh on your hero if you're in 1400 range. Seeing as how Corrosive Skin is also giving him magic resistance, he'll typically take less damage than you from any DoT.
</li></p><li><p>THIS INCLUDES RADIANCE. OH GOD NEVER BUILD A RADIANCE AGAINST VIPER.

<ul><li><p>You can Grave Chill any non-allied unit. If you see the enemy mid coming to gank you in lane, just Chill the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you're trying to catch up to an enemy for a final Soul Assumption, Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.
</li></p><li><p>Don’t sit on Soul Assumption charges. Instead of struggling to land a Familiar stun in a team fight before realizing that they all died in the chaos, worry about using Soul Assumption every time you have full bars.
</li></p><li><p>It's only once you start playing Visage that you realize that there are a lot of heroes who eat your familiars for breakfast. Bristle, Bounty Hunter, Axe, and Luna are some notable high physical damage dealers who will ice out your families easily.
</li></p><li><p>If you're against heroes like that, there are many other ways to use familiars. Use Brooklyn and Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, put them behind a lane and use them to distract the next creep wave before a dive.
</li></p><li><p>In most team fights, you'll usually want to have your familiars spit on the enemy's squishiest support. Not only can these supports not take the abuse, but most don't have a way of easily getting rid of the birds either.
</li></p><li><p>Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor, like Medallion.
</li></p><li><p>The simplest way to Familiar stun is through unit tabbing. Grave Chill the enemy, tab to a Familiar, press Q, tab again, wait around 1 second, Q again, Assume some Souls, get some kills.

<ul><li><p>An effective way to use Fatal Bonds in lane is to prepare casting it once a wave dies. Chances are the enemy will bumble into their new fresh wave as they retreat which is the perfect time to cast it. Fatal Bonds lasts 25 seconds, which is roughly the amount of time it takes a creep wave to die, so they'll probably take the full damage from however many creeps you bonded.
</li></p><li><p>You get a better heal for your buck than the DoT with Shadow Word because healing ignores magic resistance. Warlock's damage/animation/range are so good you could possibly end up being able to deal more net damage by spending the heal on yourself in lane and right clicking the enemy.
</li></p><li><p>You can and should use Shadow Word to heal your Golem. You can also use Urn of Shadows to heal it.
</li></p><li><p>Upheaval is a proactive slow, not a reactive one. This makes it a great area denial spell, especially against aggressive lanes. If enemies are choked near the side shop in lane when their wave is almost dead, just cast the whole circle behind them. Either they have to run through the entire thing, or they have to walk forward into your creeps.
</li></p><li><p>This also makes it a good spell for discouraging encounters. If your team is Roshing, don't sit there plinking away with your weak ass auto attacks. Start channeling your slow on a choke point. If you think the enemy team is about to push up high ground, start channeling Upheaval on the stairs. If your teammate is getting chased, cast the circle in front of their path from a safe distance so you can get some charge time on the slow. Even if you cancel it immediately, as long as they walked into it, enemies will be slowed for 3 seconds.
</li></p><li><p>When you drop the Golem on the enemy team and win the fight, remember to keep using it. The Golem is especially good at cutting off a creep wave during a tower push since its Flaming Fist ability deals damage in an AoE. The Golem's right clicks do chaos damage, which deals only 40% against structures anyway.
</li></p><li><p>Don't feed your Golem though. It drops a 100/150/200 gold bounty (before Agh). Deny it if you have to.
</li></p><li><p>The stun from Chaotic Offering pierces spell immunity.
</li></p><li><p>Try to get your allies to cast buffs on your Golem during the game. Surge, Ion Shell, Press the Attack, Ice Armor, Empower, Alacrity, Bloodlust, Aphotic Shield, and Mjollnir's Static Shield are a few choice examples that make the Golem especially deadly. Hell, even Dazzle can Shallow Grave the Golem.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Pay attention to who's Fatally Bonded to you in the late game. You may inadvertently be killing your carry who narrowly escaped just because you wanted to finish off Rosh.
</li></p><li><p>No matter what role you're playing, there should ALWAYS be a Diffusal Blade on your team to kill the Golem. Does any other hero have <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Warlock_responses#When_Warlock.27s_Golem_is_Purged_with_a_Diffusal_Blade">five voice responses</a> just for getting countered? The answer is no.
</li></p><li><p>Shadow Demon or Brewmaster's Purge do not instagib the Golem, but only deal some damage. Same with the tiny Satyr's Purge.

<ul><li><p>It's extremely easy to time Swarm casts during pushes. Just look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where those creeps are. If they're about to get into tower range, cast Swarm.
</li></p><li><p>Swarm has a ridiculous amount of range. The bugs travel 3000 units, making it a choice spell for scouting Rosh attempts or finding people hiding in the jungle.
</li></p><li><p>Swarm bugs draw tower aggro, making it a smart choice to Swarm someone before diving them.
</li></p><li><p>If you're chasing someone down, don't break Shukuchi immediately after passing through them. Use the remainder of the bonus speed to walk in front of them before you start attacking.
</li></p><li><p>Practice landing last hits off of the Geminated attack, rather than the initial one. If you're having trouble with the projectile timing, just stand right next to the creep and it'll feel like you have double damage. If you don't need help last hitting, use Geminate procs exclusively for harassing enemies.
</li></p><li><p>Time Lapse before casting Shukuchi. This is like the biggest mistake beginner Weavers make.
</li></p><li><p>However, Time Lapse does have a cast time, Shukuchi does not. If you're confident that the enemy has no detection or AoE spells to finish you off, just Shukuchi out.
</li></p><li><p>Use Time Lapse liberally in lane. This isn't Reincarnation, the spell only has a minute cooldown at level 6.
</li></p><li><p>Time doesn't tick down for Time Lapse even if you're dead. You can Time Lapse the moment you spawn after being dead for 40 seconds and show up to where you were 5 seconds before you died.
</li></p><li><p>This ties into the whole 'buyback insta-Time Lapse' tactic. It's a dangerously cheesy strategy, but it works sometimes.
</li></p><li><p>If the enemy has a lot of silences on their team, buy a Manta Style early on to purge them off.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Try to use Dust after he Shukuchis. This way Weaver has to either instantly Time Lapse to wipe it off and be Shukuchi-less or he'll just eat the dust.
</li></p><li><p>Try not to reveal you have a Sentry Ward in lane. Weavers Shukuchi deeeeep into creep waves whenever they're trying to get the nuke damage, but they won't do that if they know you have detection. Let Weaver get complacent before you try to go for a kill.
</li></p><li><p>It always takes 4 hits from a hero to shake a Swarm bug off you.
</li></p><li><p>You need to pick heroes with cheap Linken's breakers or good silences when drafting against Weaver.
</li></p><li><p>Orchid is great, but beware the Linken's.

<div id="103"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/windrunner_full.png" alt="Windranger"></span><span id=name>Windranger</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Hold on to the Shackle for as long as you can. If you can't find a good angle or secondary target to land a Shackle, just sit on it.
</li></p><li><p>What sets good Windrangers apart from bad Windrangers is how frequently Shackles are cast on creeps. Bad Windrangers will almost always target it on the hero even if there's a far larger window to miss the latch. Shackle prioritizes hero targets first, so casting it on creeps is often times safer than casting it on a hero and banking on a tree or another unit to show up.
</li></p><li><p>Shackleshot can latch to invisible units. If you know where an invisible target is (like Sand King in Sand Storm), then you can try to position a creep in such a way that you can land the enemy hero as the secondary target.
</li></p><li><p>Use Powershot to scout Rosh attempts or check high ground fog.
</li></p><li><p>Windrun has a slowing component to the spell. If you're chasing someone down with your team, try to spend your entire Windrun within 300 radius of the enemy (the radius of the slow).
</li></p><li><p>Windrun can evade tower shots and fountain attacks.
</li></p><li><p>Windrun can disjoint attack projectiles.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Constantly keep her in your camera when laning against her. Powershot is not an easy spell for her to land, but it is if you're asleep at the wheel. Watch where she's aiming and move away.
</li></p><li><p>Get an MKB to deal with Windrun if Windranger is turning into a strong damage dealer.
</li></p><li><p>Windrun gives 100% evasion against physical <i>attacks</i>, but physical <i>damage</i> can still hurt her. This includes spells like Omnislash or Exorcism.

<ul><li><p>Cask stuns creeps for 5 seconds instead of 1, making WD a real pain for heroes like Chen or Enchantress.
</li></p><li><p>Cask also stuns illusion for 5 seconds, not 1. This makes it easier to identify which target is the real hero.
</li></p><li><p>Cask can bounce to units in fog. If someone is escaping in the jungle, you can gamble casting it on neutrals and praying to the Ogre of Magi, the Patron Saint of RNG, that it'll bounce to the enemy.
</li></p><li><p>Voodoo Restoration is one of the cheapest ways to heal at early levels. WD's animation and damage are so dope that it can be worth spending your mana on healing yourself for persistent harass and saving Cask for kill attempts.
</li></p><li><p>You can toggle Voodoo while channeling (TPs or Death Ward).
</li></p><li><p>If you're trying to heal allies just right click on them to follow them, rather than starting the impromptu Dota Hoedown that always occurs whenever people are fumbling to get into the heal AoE.
</li></p><li><p>Maledict can be a good way to keep a Blink Dagger on cooldown. It lasts for 12 seconds and you can place the debuff on spell immune enemies (though it won't start damaging them until they lose spell immunity).
</li></p><li><p><b>You can choose your Death Ward's target.</b> If you have the 'Unified Unit Orders' option checked, then you can just ctrl+right click who you want it to attack and you won't break your channel. Or, if you have your hero and the Death Ward selected and issue an attack command, it'll only send it to the Ward. Otherwise just select it manually and right click the prioritized target.
</li></p><li><p>Death Ward's cast range isn't too shabby. You want to try to exploit the full range every time you cast it so that enemies have to eat more attacks to stop your channeling.
</li></p><li><p>You can cast Shadow Blade/Shadow Amulet while channeling Death Ward, but nine times out of ten BKB a smarter item to get.
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Don't sit around next to your ranged creep once the rest of your creep wave dies. You're just asking for a Casking.
</li></p><li><p>Maledict deals extra damage depending on how much damage you've taken since the last tick. If you heal yourself, you'll take less damage on the next curse tick.
</li></p><li><p>The extra curse damage tick from Maledict triggers once every 4 seconds. Try timing whatever invincibility you may have (like from a banish) at those times.
</li></p><li><p>Someone on your team needs to be dedicated to canceling WD's ult. You only need one stun/silence/banish to completely shut it down, but it's not worth wasting all your team's resources to stop it.
</li></p><li><p>Death Ward can't hit ethereal units, making Ghost Scepter a suitable option if you're a support who keeps dying to the ult.

<ul><li><p>Wraithfire Blast is a slow projectile and the animation is extremely obvious. Use the stun as close to the enemy as you can to prevent people from disjointing it or running away.
</li></p><li><p>Soul Ring is considered core on Wraith King to ensure that you'll have mana to Reincarnate at the last moment. Be sure to keep at least 10 mana in the bank, though, because Soul Ring will only give you 150.
</li></p><li><p>Sometimes it's advisable to sit on the skill point for Reincarnate. There's no point putting the spell on cooldown early on if your team can't take advantage of it, so decide to level it when you need it.

<div id="106"><div id=herotitle><span id=portrait><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/zuus_full.png" alt="Zeus"></span><span id=name>Zeus</span></div><div id="tips"><h1>Tips</h1>
<ul><li><p>Zeus's auto attack damage and range and animation and projectile speed are all pretty garbage, making it almost a necessity to last hit with Arc Lightning. As a result, your lane enemy will almost certainly have a Magic Stick. If you're mid, this means you should try to exclusively cast Arc from the high ground. Enemies only get Stick charges if the caster is in vision.
</li></p><li><p>Lightning Bolt gives vision, Arc Lightning does not. Cast Lightning Bolt first if you're chasing someone to make sure you don't lose your target in fog.
</li></p><li><p>Lightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.
</li></p><li><p>Don't forget about Lightning Bolt's ground targeting capabilities. Early game you don't really have the mana to burn to use it for dewarding unless you're 100% sure you know where a ward is. Late game, though, you should be casting it all over the place to counterward.
</li></p><li><p>If you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.
</li></p><li><p>If you think someone is just about to escape vision, don't risk casting Lightning Bolt on the hero, just cast it on the ground right behind them.
</li></p><li><p>The ground targeting also adds a bonus 325 range to the spell. This means it's just barely long enough to hit heroes from the edge of your stairs mid to the edge of the enemy's stairs mid.
</li></p><li><p>Static Field damages units in fog. This is more a nuisance than anything else because it means that jungle creeps love seeing what the hubbub is about whenever Zeus is fighting in the jungle.
</li></p><li><p>Static Field can break Blink Daggers in a 1200 radius around yourself. If you're out of position and you see someone like Bat or Mag closing in on you, a ground targeted Lightning Bolt right in front of yourself can buy a few seconds.
</li></p><li><p>Try to maintain mana for your ult in the early game. The potential of getting a kill on a hero from across the map will be probably more useful than the 3 last hits you picked up with Arc Lightning.
</li></p><li><p>While you theoretically do more damage with Static Field by casting Thundergod's Wrath at the beginning of a team fight, it's can be better to save it for the middle/end of a fight. Players always react differently in a team fight depending on how much HP they have. By holding on to your ult, you can create a situation where the enemy will commit deeper than they wanted to because they didn't consider how much damage your ult would deal.
</li></p><li><p>You can use your ult as temporary counter-initiation against teams with a lot of Blink Daggers.
</li></p><li><p>Don't blow your load if you see the enemies have a Pipe up. Try burning off as much of it as you can solely with Arc Lightning+Static Field or just wait for it to time out (Pipe only lasts 10 seconds).
</li></p></ul>
<h1>Counters</h1>
<ul><li><p>Buy a Smoke of Deceit against Zeus. Thundergod's Wrath only reveals invisible units, but does not damage them. But even then, Smoke is a weird type of invis, so even a Refreshed Thundergod's Wrath wouldn't kill you. Buy a smoke. Use it when escaping with low HP. Laugh at Zeus in all chat.
</li></p><li><p>No matter who you're playing, it's almost always worth getting a Cloak against Zeus. Even if your team is building a Pipe, get a Cloak.
</li></p><li><p>But you should definitely have a Pipe on your team against Zeus also.
