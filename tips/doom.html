		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You get bonus HP regeneration for the entire duration of a creep being consumed under Devour.</li>
			<li>Leaving Devour on autocast (which can be toggled by right clicking the spell icon or pressing alt+hotkey) allows you to
				steal abilities from neutral creeps. Toggle it off when you want to Devour a creep that has some useless spell so you don't
				replace whatever ability you already have consumed.</li>
			<li>Learn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which ones best match your playstyle. Get
				a Hill Troll Priest from an easy camp early game for the mana aura, Centaur from a medium camp mid game for
				the Stomp, and an Alpha Wolf from a medium camp late game for the crits and aura. If you're jungling, try to
				get the big red Satyr for the HP regen or the blue Ogre for the Ice Armor.</li>
			<li>The ranged Satyr's purge can target and dispel allies.</li>
			<li>The Tornado from the Wildwing Ripper does not draw aggro when used on neutral creeps, allowing you to damage an entire stack
				or kill ancients without them moving around constantly.</li>
			<li>If enemies are picking up Linken's, find a neutral spell that is targeted to pop them before casting Doom.
				The longest range targeted neutral spell is the Harpy's Chain Lightning (900 range), and the Mud Golem's Hurl
				Boulder is a close second (800 range).</li>
			<li>You can Devour creeps that are Glyphed.</li>
			<li>You can Devour Necronomicon units, but you won't get their abilities.</li>
			<li>The Scorched Earth movespeed bonus also applies to units under your control that are in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Agh's upgraded Infernal Blade applies a Break on the target.</li>
			<li><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> Mutes activation/usage of items.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay attention to what creep ability Doom has by clicking on him. Don't get surprised when his team
				rushes out of nowhere because he has the Kobold aura or if he breaks your channel because he took a Centaur
				Stomp.</li>
			<li>Linken's Sphere is the textbook anti-Doom item. Lotus Orb is also good for offensive situations.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel can significantly reduce the regen he gets from Devour.</li>
			<li>Please deny your allies when they're Doomed. I'm not walking near you because I want you to tell my wife I
				love her, I need you to kill me.</li>
			<li>However, you ideally want to click on your ally and track how much time is left on the Doom debuff icon
				because deny range != dead range.</li>
			<li><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> Mutes activation/usage of items, including that Magic Wand that I know you want to use
				so badly because it should be enough to just barely sav... you're dead.</li>
			<li>If you get Doomed with an a Armlet toggled on you can backpack it to stop the drain.</li>
