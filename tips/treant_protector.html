		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The vines from Nature's Grasp count as "trees" for Nature's Guise innate buffs.
			<ul><li>Trees planted by items (like an Iron Branch) or spells (like Nature's Prophet's Sprout) also work with Nature's Guise.</li></ul>
			<li>If you're already affected by Nature's Guise, you won't lose the buff even if you take damage. Try to stay in
				trees or on your Grasp vines as much as possible to preserve the free pathing.</li>
			<li>You will maintain Nature's Guise invisibility even while using spells or items.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed an enemy creep to heal your own wave when pushing.</li>
			<li>If you last hit a unit with Leech Seed's damage, it won't pulse out heals.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor on buildings to heal them.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor on creep-heroes like Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap or by clicking on the portraits at the top of the screen. You can hold
				ALT to see all your allies current HP under their top bar portraits.
				<ul><li>Fun Fact: You can even see teammate buyback status in the top bar by holding ALT. If they have a gold border at
					the bottom of their HP/mana, they can buyback. This isn't a Treant specific tip, it's just good to know.</li></ul>
			<li>Overgrowth is a rare type of root that can also cancel enemy channeled spells. It even cancels channels through debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>Enemy carries will typically save BKB/Manta to dispel Overgrowth after you cast it. This leads to a dangerous game of chicken.
				Most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out and dispel the bind in a team fight
				and hope disabling their allies is good enough.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth won't connect on invisible targets, but it will provide true sight on all bound targets for its duration.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Eyes in the Forest provides unobstructed flying vision. This allows you to even peek into the Rosh
				pit.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Living Armor makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit with the survivability the spell provides, so be careful with early game
				aggression.</li>
			<li>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant thanks to Living Armor's heal. You have to
				fully commit to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time. There's nothing Treant players love more than seeing a solo hero
				waste time whittling a tower down by 10% and there's nothing they hate more than seeing five heroes wrecking ball towers from a 100 to 0.</li>
			<li>Activate BKB, Manta Style, Disperser, Satanic, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, Eul's or any other basic dispel <i>after</i> you've been bound by Overgrowth
				to remove the bind.</li>
			<li>In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. Treant Protector is much more annoying when he's able to
				weave in and out of a treeline thanks to his Nature's Guise innate, so just deforest the entire lane and you'll have a much easier time.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>In addition to attacking Agh's Shard Eyes in the Forest, any spells that destroy trees will also kill the Eye.</li>
