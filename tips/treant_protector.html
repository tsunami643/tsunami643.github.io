		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For Nature's Grasp to get the tree bonuses, it needs to be touching a tree on cast. You can't plant a tree
				in the AoE to get the bonuses after casting.</li>
			<li>In addition to casting spells, Treant can use items while he's Nature's Guise'd. If you have the
				"Nature's Guise Invisibility" talent you will maintain invisibility even while using spells or items.</li>
			<li>Nature's Guise regen bonuses only work on HP regen, not mana regen.</li>
			<li>If you're already affected by Nature's Guise, you won't lose the buff even if you take damage. Try to stay in
				trees as much as possible to preserve the free pathing.</li>
			<li>Trees planted by items or spells work with Nature's Guise.</li>
			<li>Use Leech Seed on a frontline enemy creep to heal your own creeps when pushing.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed will continue pulsing heals even after the target dies.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed works on fogged and invisible units. You can use the particle effects of the heals to track
				the debuffed target.</li>
			<li>The tracking goes both ways, however. Be wary of enemies following the Leech Seed particles to your location
				when you're hiding in trees.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap or by clicking on the portraits at the top of the screen. You can hold
				ALT to see all your allies current HP under their topbar portraits.</li>
			<li>Since everyone knows to not BKB/Manta until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken
				with enemy carries. Most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out in a teamfight
				and hope disabling the other enemies is sufficient.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth can cancel enemy channels even through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth won't connect on invisible targets, but it will provide true sight on all rooted targets for its duration.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can place Agh's Scepter Eyes in the Forest on Iron Branch trees. Iron Branch trees last for 20 seconds.
				This can potentially be useful for high ground defenses or sieges where trees are hard to come by.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Living Armor makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit with the survivability the spell provides, so be careful with early game
				aggression.</li>
			<li>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant thanks to Living Armor's heal. You have to
				commit fully to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time.</li>
			<li>Cast BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or any other dispel <i>after</i> you're Overgrowth'd to break out of it.</li>
			<li>In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. Treant Protector is much more annoying when he's able to
				weave in and out of a treeline, so just deforest the entire lane and you'll have a much easier time.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If Treant has an Agh's Scepter, you should really carry a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to chop down
				the Eyes. Force Staff/Hurricane Pike can also work in a pinch.</li>
