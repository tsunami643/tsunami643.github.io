		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Treant can use items while he's Nature's Guise'd. This is useful for stealthily planting wards in enemy
				territory or for using a TP while invis and arriving to your destination still invis.</li>
			<li>You still have collision when Guise'd, so you will block paths and bump into heroes.</li>
			<li>During pushes, save Leech Seed for when the creep waves clash under a tower so your creeps won't run
				away from the heal.</li>
			<li>The two aspects of Living Armor (the heal and the block) are not separate buffs like with TA's
				Refraction. If you take too many damage instances, you will lose the heal. Assume that all your allies
				are idiots and don't understand how 'damage instances' work and avoid healing teammates when they're
				aggro'd by a bunch of creeps or neutrals.</li>
			<li>Avoid casting Living Armor on a tower unless you know that the enemy creep wave is far away for the same
				reason.</li>
			<li>If you use Living Armor on a tower while it's Glyphed, the damage instances won't tick down.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor and Nature's Guise on the courier.</li>
			<li>There are always occasions when you can be using Living Armor. In the early game, be policing your lanes
				if anyone needs the heal. If no one needs the heal, then see if someone can benefit from the block. If
				no heroes need it, then look at towers. In the late game, when you're struggling for relevance, you can
				always cast it on creeps to ever so slowly help a push.</li>
			<li>Since everyone knows to not BKB until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken
				with enemy carries. You can cancel the Overgrowth cast against dumber enemies, but most of the time
				you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>It's usually not worth buying Dust just for Nature's Guise in most games, but it is a good idea to keep
				a sentry in the vicinity when your team is pushing an enemy tower to protect against Treant surprise
				Overgrowthing your team.</li>
			<li>Nature's Guise is purgable.</li>
			<li>You can see the Living Armor buff on enemy heroes if you click on them to check the number of block
				instances left and the amount of time left.</li>
			<li>DoT spells are good at burning off Living Armor since each damage tick will take off one block
				instance.</li>
			<li>The Living Armor damage block makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit, so avoid early game
				aggression.</li>
			<li>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant, you have to commit fully to every tower
				push, otherwise you're just wasting your time.</li>
			<li>If Treant is solo laning, consider aggressively pushing as soon as possible. It may seem
				counterintuitive, but if Tree has to blow Armor on healing his tower, that means he's not using it to
				help his teammates.</li>
			<li>Cast BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or Diffusal Purge AFTER you're Overgrowth'd to
				break out of it.</li>
