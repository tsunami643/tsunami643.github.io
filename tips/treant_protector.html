		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For Nature's Grasp to get the tree bonuses, it needs to be touching a tree on cast.
				<ul><li><span class="facet"></span>As a result, you <i>can't</i> plant a Leech Seed tree with the "Sapling" facet
					in the Nature's Grasp AoE to get the bonuses after casting.</li></ul>
			<li>The vines from Nature's Grasp count as "trees" for Nature's Guise innate buffs.
			<ul><li>Trees planted by items (like an Iron Branch) or spells (like Nature's Prophet's Sprout) also work with Nature's Guise.</li>
				<li><span class="facet"></span>The tree planted by Leech Seed with the "Sapling" facet also counts for Guise buffs.</li></ul>
			<li>If you're already affected by Nature's Guise, you won't lose the buff even if you take damage. Try to stay in
				trees or on your Grasp vines as much as possible to preserve the free pathing.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If you have Agh's Shard, you will maintain Nature's Guise invisibility
				even while using spells or items.</li>
			<li>Use Leech Seed on a frontline enemy creep to heal your own creeps when pushing.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed will continue pulsing heals even after the target dies.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed works on fogged and invisible units. You can use the particle effects of the heals to track
				the debuffed target.
			<ul><li>The tracking goes both ways, however. Be wary of enemies following the Leech Seed particles to your location
				when you're hiding in trees.</li></ul>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor on buildings to heal them.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor on creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's
				Primal Split Brewlings.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap or by clicking on the portraits at the top of the screen. You can hold
				ALT to see all your allies current HP under their top bar portraits.
				<ul><li>Fun Fact: You can even see teammate buyback status in the top bar by holding ALT. If they have a gold border at
					the bottom of their HP/mana, they can buyback.</li></ul>
			<li>Since everyone knows to not BKB/Manta until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken
				with enemy carries. Most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out and dispel themselves in a team fight
				and hope disabling the other enemies is sufficient.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth is a rare type of root that can also cancel enemy channeled spells. It even cancels channels through debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth won't connect on invisible targets, but it will provide true sight on all rooted targets for its duration.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can place Agh's Scepter Eyes in the Forest on Iron Branch trees.
				This can potentially be useful for high ground defenses or sieges where trees are hard to come by.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>While holding Agh's Scepter, all trees on the map will respawn 10 seconds after
				they're killed.
			<ul><li>Now for the more <i>forbidden</i> tech. Whenever you pick up Agh's Scepter on Treant,
				all trees on the map instantly respawn. Read: <i>Whenever you <u>pick up</u> Agh's Scepter</i>. This means you can just constantly
				drop/backpack your Agh's Scepter and put it back in your inventory for immediate tree respawns. This even works while you're dead.</li>
				<li>Trees can only respawn if there's nothing standing on top of where they would respawn. If there's a unit blocking their spawn point,
					they won't regrow until the unit moves.</li>
				<li>Your Eyes in the Forest will stop giving vision while you don't have Agh's in your active inventory, but they won't disappear.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Living Armor makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit with the survivability the spell provides, so be careful with early game
				aggression.</li>
			<li>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant thanks to Living Armor's heal. You have to
				fully commit to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time. There's nothing Treant players love more than seeing a solo hero
				waste time whittling a tower down by 10% and there's nothing they hate more than seeing five heroes wrecking ball towers from a 100 to 0.</li>
			<li>Activate BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or Disperser or Satanic or any other dispel <i>after</i> you're Overgrowth'd to break out of it.</li>
			<li>In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. Treant Protector is much more annoying when he's able to
				weave in and out of a treeline, so just deforest the entire lane and you'll have a much easier time.</li>
			<li>The "Light Collector" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you which can help you find a Treant Protector hiding with his
				Nature's Guise innate.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If Treant has an Agh's Scepter, you should really carry a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to chop down
				the Eyes. Force Staff/Hurricane Pike/Harpoon can also work in a pinch.</li>
		</ul>
