		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Lane creeps, neutral creeps, or tower attacks won't wake enemies up from Echo Stomp.</li>
			<li>If you Echo Stomp while the Spirit isn't out, both the magical and physical damage instances will work off your hero.</li>
			<li>Don't start whaling on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get
				into a better position, then go to town.</li>
			<li>For the first 0.8s of Stomp sleep, you can hit enemies without them waking up.</li>
			<li>Cast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy
				team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will
				start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns at 600 move speed, players won't always react quick
				enough to dodge it.</li>
			<li>If you animation cancel Echo Stomp with the stop key before the channel begins you'll avoid casting the spell on your hero,
				but the Spirit will go through the full Stomp animation.</li>
			<li>Casting Stomp off your Spirit while your hero is disabled will just have the Spirit go through the animation,
				put the spell on CD, and use mana, but the spell won't work on either the hero or the Spirit.</li>
			<li>Stomp's AoE is 500 and the Spirit's damage AoE is 275. You can sneakily Stomp enemies by having your
				Spirit cast while hiding in an adjacent treeline during T1 and T2 tower defenses and sieges.</li>
			<li>The Spirit walks around as fast as ET is at the time of casting. This means that a Surged ET will have a
				Surge-speed Spirit.</li>
			<li>This also makes Phase Boots surprisingly great on ET since you can activate Phase and then cast Spirit
				and have it roam around at Phased speeds for its entire duration.</li>
			<li>Having your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not
				planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending
				it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.</li>
			<li>You can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. Spirit starts cooling
				down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned. When the Spirit comes back from its semester
				abroad, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage and you'll have another Spirit ready in the
				chamber to finish them off.</li>
			<li>The Spirit's MS/Damage buffs are refreshed, not replaced, if active when a new Spirit is Returned. So if you
				walked on top of 10 units with a Spirit, Returned it, and have time to cast a new Spirit during the 9s buff duration,
				you can send it out, have it walk on just a single unit, Return it, and refresh the buffs from the 10 unit Spirit.</li>
			<li>Use the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.</li>
			<li>The Spirit can absorb Hookshot, Meat Hook, and Sacred Arrow. It can also serve as a jump target for a Jugg Omnislash.</li>
			<li>During chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run
				through the whole thing and risk getting slept or they have to change paths.</li>
			<li>Anyone on your team can teleport to the Spirit using Boots of Travel 1.</li>
			<li>You can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow the target for its
				duration.</li>
			<li>Ideally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the
				smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>With shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter
				is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be
				dealing to you.</li>
			<li>Similarly, Force Staff gives you an easy eject button if you're getting comboed into some of his
				spells.</li>
			<li>If the Spirit is going through the Stomp animation, but you're not hearing the 'charging' sound effect,
				Titan's trying to mindgame you and canceled the cast.</li>
			<li>Oracle can wake allies up from Echo Stomp with Purifying Flames' damage. Pudge can wake himself up with Rot.</li>
