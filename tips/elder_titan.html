		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you Echo Stomp while the Spirit isn't out, both the magical and physical damage instances will work off your hero.</li>
			<li>Don't start whaling on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get
				into a better position, then go to town.</li>
			<li>Echo Stomped targets will wake up once they take more than 50/100/150/200 cumulative damage minus the Echo Stomp damage.</li>
			<li>Cast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy
				team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will
				start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns way faster than it walks normally, players won't always react quick
				enough to dodge it.</li>
			<li>If you spam stop-cancel on Echo Stomp's cast animation when the Spirit is returning, you can slow the time it takes for it
				to return substantially.</li>
			<li>There is no difference between casting Echo Stomp from your Spirit or from your hero. However, if your hero is taunted, you can
				cast Echo Stomp from your Spirit and then both your hero and the Spirit will start channeling the spell. This only works when
				taunted, not under stuns or silences.</li>
			<li>The Spirit walks around as fast as ET is at the time of casting. This means that a Surged ET will have a
				Surge-speed Spirit.</li>
			<li>This makes Phase Boots surprisingly great on ET since you can activate Phase and then cast Spirit
				and have it roam around at Phased speeds for its entire duration.</li>
			<li>Natural Order armor reduction aura is centered around the hero, and the magical reduction aura is centered around the Spirit.</li>
			<li>Having your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not
				planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending
				it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.</li>
			<li>It can be in your benefit to stack neutral camps near your lane so you can gain a lot of damage by running your
				Spirit over more creeps.</li>
			<li>You can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. Spirit starts cooling
				down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned. When the Spirit comes back from its semester
				abroad, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage and you'll have another Spirit ready in the
				chamber to finish them off.</li>
			<li>The Spirit's bonus buffs are refreshed, not replaced, if active when a new Spirit is Returned. So if you
				walked on top of 10 units with a Spirit, Returned it, and have time to cast a new Spirit during the buff duration,
				you can send it out, have it walk on just a single unit, Return it, and refresh the buffs from the 10 unit Spirit.</li>
			<li>Use the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.</li>
			<li>During chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run
				through the whole thing and risk getting Stomped or they have to change directions.</li>
			<li>You can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow the target for its
				duration.</li>
			<li>Ideally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the
				smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>With shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter
				is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be
				dealing to you.</li>
			<li>Along those lines, Force Staff gives you an easy eject button if you're getting comboed into some of his
				spells.</li>
			<li>Oracle can wake allies up from Echo Stomp with Purifying Flames' damage. Pudge can wake himself up with Rot.</li>
			<li>Elder Titans will often stack your camps in lane just so they can get more Spirit damage. It sounds crazy, but
				you should try blocking your own camps to stop him from doing this.</li>
