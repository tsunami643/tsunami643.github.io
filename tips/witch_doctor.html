		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cask can bounce to units in fog. If someone is escaping in the jungle, you can gamble casting it on
				neutrals and praying to the Ogre of Magi, the Patron Saint of RNG, that it'll bounce to the enemy.</li>
			<li>Cask pops Linken's when targeted or bouncing into a hero, but it'll continue bouncing afterwards.</li>
			<li>The fewer units there are around, the more effective Cask is at stunning. In lane, try to pop an enemy with
				Cask after all their melee creeps die and only the lone ranged creep remains as a bounce target for maximum pinballing.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Voodoo Restoration while channeling (TPs or Death Ward). This is extremely important when playing against
				a Rubick to make sure he can't easily steal your Death Ward.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to heal allies just right click on them to follow them (assuming you don't have right click denies enabled), rather than starting the
				impromptu Dota Hoedown that always occurs whenever people are fumbling to get into the heal AoE.</li>
			<li>Maledict can be a good way to keep an enemy Blink Dagger on cooldown since it lasts for so long.</li>
			<li><b><i>You can choose your Death Ward's target.</b></i> If you have the 'Unified Unit Orders' option checked,
				then you can just ctrl+right click who you want it to attack and you won't break your channel. Or,
				if you have your hero and the Death Ward selected and issue an attack command, it'll only send it
				to the Ward since you're channeling. Otherwise, just select it manually and right click your target.</li>
			<li>Death Ward's cast range isn't too shabby. You want to try to exploit the full range every time you cast
				it so that enemies can't easily get to you to stop your channeling.</li>
			<li>Death Ward requires vision of the target to hit them. Beware of casting the Death Ward on low ground or
				near a bunch of trees because your target may escape into fog.</li>
			<li>The Death Ward also provides vision around the unit itself (1200 day/800 night). The vision lingers for 5 seconds
				after the Death Ward disappears.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo's Death Ward behaves identically to a normal Death Ward.
				This means it benefits from Death Ward talents and the Agh's Scepter Death Ward bonuses.
				<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>This also means you can control the target of the Agh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo
				Death Ward by right clicking on the enemy you want to attack.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You're stuck in the Agh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo for the entire cast. You can't cancel it early,
				it's not a channel, it's more like a fixed duration banish.</li>
			<li>Activating Glimmer Cape/Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade <i>will not</i> cancel channels, so you can use these items
				in the middle of channeling Death Ward.</li>
			<li>Activating Ghost Scepter or BKB <i>will</i> cancel channels, so use these items <i>before</i> you start channeling
				Death Ward.</li>
			<li>Aeon Disk being triggered on Witch Doctor does not stop Death Ward from dealing damage since wards are considered
				separate units. Same reason why an enemy with Blade Mail won't reflect any Death Ward damage onto Witch Doctor.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Death Ward attacks can bounce to creeps. This can be useful against zoo teams
				with a lot of summons/units.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't sit around next to your ranged creep once the rest of your creep wave dies. You're just asking for
				a Casking.</li>
			<li>Maledict deals extra damage depending on the amount of HP you've lost since the debuff was applied. If
				you heal yourself, you'll take less damage on the next curse tick.</li>
			<li>The burst damage tick from Maledict triggers once every 4 seconds. Try timing whatever
				invincibility you may have (like from a banish) at those times.</li>
			<li>Someone on your team needs to be dedicated to canceling WD's ult. You only need one stun/silence/banish
				to completely shut it down.</li>
			<li>Death Ward can't hit ethereal units. This makes Ghost Scepter a useful item if you're a support who
				keeps dying to the ult.</li>
