		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Abaddon's Withering Mist innate only reduces health restoration <i>not</i> incoming heals.</li>
			<li>Any damage you deal to enemies, from attacks, spells, or items, will apply your Withering Mist innate.</li>
			<li>The self-damage on Mist Coil can be absorbed by Aphotic Shield and will heal you during Borrowed Time.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off most disables and debuffs, including stuns.</li>
			<li>You can cast Aphotic Shield on creeps. Handy for split pushing.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield will always burst for the full damage regardless of damage absorbed even if it gets dispelled off.
			<ul><li>You can replace a Shield on a target to burst it on demand for the damage.</li>
				<li>Aphotic Shield's burst won't damage units in fog or invisible units, even if they're in the AoE.</li></ul>
			<li>The Aphotic Shield buff lasts for quite a while, so you can consider casting it on yourself for free in the fountain
				before TPing to a lane.</li>
			<li>Abaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're
				pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling
				Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to
				cast the Shield, but if you've got godlike reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.</li>
			<li>Barriers, like the one from Aphotic Shield, will absorb damage <i>before</i> on-damage effects are triggered on a hero. This means that Salves,
				Clarities, Bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, and sleeps won't get broken by damage until the barrier expires.
			<ul><li>Borrowed Time also means you don't receive 'damage,' so you can take advantage of all the aforementioned
				interactions under Borrowed Time as well. Mainly useful for Blinking during Borrowed Time.</li>
				<li>Aphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.</li></ul>
			<li>The attack speed buff from Curse of Avernus works on buildings.</li>
			<li>You can manually activate Borrowed Time for a strong dispel even when stunned or under other types of non-silence disables.
				<ul><li>It can be worth manually triggering Borrowed Time if you and your whole team are stunned. That way you can strong dispel
					off your stun and then immediately put an Aphotic Shield on an ally to dispel their stun as well.</li></ul>
			<li>Break prevents Borrowed Time from auto-triggering, so you'll need to manually cast it against Silver Edge
				carriers or other Breaks. Be sure to check at the beginning of the game if there are any potential Agh's
				Shards/Scepters or talents that provide Breaks <i>before</i> they get you killed.</li>
			<li>Abaddon is an ideal hero to keep auras on (Vlad's, Drum, Shiva's) since he takes too much time for
				teams to kill early on in a fight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge, but it doesn't damage targets in fog. If a target with Aphotic Shield
				is trying to explode on you, try to juke them in trees and stay out of vision.
			<ul><li>Aphotic Shield can be dispelled off enemies. However, it will burst for the full damage once dispelled.</li></ul>
			<li>If you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever auto
				triggering.</li>
			<li>"Kill check" spells like Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Axe's Culling Blade can kill through Borrowed Time
				if Abaddon is below the kill check HP threshold.</li>
			<li>Borrowed Time will auto-trigger and strong dispel Abaddon even if he's silenced/hexed.
			<ul><li>You can Break Abaddon so Borrowed Time won't auto-trigger and then silence him so Borrowed Time can't
				be manually cast to work around his ultimate.</li>
				<li>Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include
				Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Naga Siren's Agh's Scepter Ensnare, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Scepter Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike,
				and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Break#Sources">a few others.</a></li></ul>
			<li>Eul's Scepter can be a useful Abaddon counter since it can waste a few seconds of Borrowed Time while he's spinning
				in the air.</li>
			<li>The HP Abaddon heals with spells like Mist Coil or Borrowed Time can only be reduced by sources that manipulate <i>incoming heals</i>:
				<ul><li>Debuffs that can reduce incoming heals: Spirit Vessel, Eye of Skadi, and Shiva's Guard.</li>
					<li>To clarify, the 'incoming heal' manipulation mechanic differs from generic 'health restoration' manipulation.
						Health restoration comes from sources like lifesteal or just passive HP/s increases (like from Tango, Healing Salve,
						Alchemist's Chemical Rage, or Morphling STR Attribute Shifting). These can be reduced by things like Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia
						or Orb of Corrosion.</li>
					<li>However, heals that come from burst sources like Magic Wand, Healing Lotus, Dazzle's Shadow Wave,
						Omniknight's Purification or incremental heals like Oracle's Purifying Flames, Phoenix's Sun Ray, or Pugna's Life Drain are <i>not</i> considered
						'health restoration' but instead 'incoming heals.'</li>
					<li>If you're not sure what type of HP regen a debuff manipulates, the tooltip needs to say it affects 'health restoration' <i>and</i> 'incoming heals.'
						Spirit Vessel, for example, states both.</li>
					<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom also prevent enemies from gaining any HP.</li>
					</ul>
			<li>Abaddon's Withering Mist innate health restoration reduction behaves similar to an Orb of Corrosion if you're below the
				HP threshold and he damages you.</li>
