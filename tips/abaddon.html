		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The self-damage on Mist Coil can be absorbed by Aphotic Shield and will heal you during Borrowed Time.</li>
			<li>Mist Coil can heal spell immune allies.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off any disable, including stuns.</li>
			<li>You can cast Aphotic Shield on creeps. Handy for split pushing.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield will always detonate for the full damage regardless of damage absorbed.</li>
			<li>You can replace a Shield on a target to detonate it on demand for the damage.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield's explosion won't damage units in fog or invisible units, even if they're in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Abaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're
				pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling
				Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to
				cast the shield, but if you've got godlike reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.</li>
			<li>If you or an ally gets attacked by a hero while Aphotic Shield is on, the game will act like you haven't
				taken damage from that hero. This means that Salves, Clarities, Bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, and
				sleeps won't get broken.</li>
			<li>Borrowed Time also means you don't receive 'damage,' so you can take advantage of all the aforementioned
				interactions under Borrowed Time as well.</li>
			<li>Illusions of Abaddon can add Curse of Avernus stacks.</li>
			<li>Curse of Avernus works on buildings.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.</li>
			<li>You can manually activate Borrowed Time when stunned or under other types of non-silence disables to instantly
				dispel them.</li>
			<li>It can be worth manually triggering Borrowed Time if you and your whole team are stunned. That way you can strong dispel
				off your stun and then immediately put an Aphotic Shield on an ally to dispel their stun as well.</li>
			<li>Break prevents Borrowed Time from auto-triggering, so you'll need to manually cast it against Silver Edge
				carriers or other Breaks.</li>
			<li>Abaddon is an ideal hero to keep auras on (Vlad's, Drum, Shiva's) since he takes too much time for
				teams to kill early on in a fight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge (675 AoE).</li>
			<li>If a target with Aphotic Shield is trying to explode on you, try to abuse fog of war. If the enemy can't
				see you, the Shield detonation won't do any damage.</li>
			<li>Aphotic Shield can be dispelled off enemies, however it will explode for the full damage once dispelled.</li>
			<li>Curse of Avernus stacks and the full silence debuff can both be dispelled.</li>
			<li>Since Abaddon illusions can apply Curse of Avernus stacks, Terrorblade's Reflection or Shadow Demon's Disruption
				can be annoying for Abaddon to deal with.</li>
			<li>If you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever auto
				triggering.</li>
			<li>Borrowed Time will auto-trigger even if Abaddon is hexed.</li>
			<li>You can Break him so Borrowed Time won't auto-trigger and then silence him so Borrowed Time can't
				be manually cast to work around his ultimate.</li>
			<li>If you don't trust your team, Eul's is a great Abaddon counter since it can waste 2.5s of Borrowed
				Time.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast prevents Abaddon from healing during Borrowed Time. Bane's Enfeeble also reduces health restoration.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel can lower the amount of HP he'll heal in Borrowed Time, assuming he doesn't dispel
				it with Aphotic Shield. Items like Shiva's or Skadi can also provide heal reduction	.</li>
