		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Laser's 100% blind is a big deal. Early game, you can keep it in your pocket for when a right click hero
				dives you. Once maxed, it lasts about as long as a Heaven's Halberd disarm.</li>
			<li>Laser's blind works on Rosh.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Agh's Scepter Shrink Ray debuff on Laser is linked to the blind debuff and will last
				the same amount of time.</li>
			<li>Defense Matrix buffs are removed whenever the barrier is lost.</li>
			<li>Avoid drying yourself out of mana every time you TP on the lane in the late game. Keep mana in the bank to deal
				with a Rearm or Keen Conveyance getting broken. At the very least, keep your Soul Ring off cooldown whenever you're
				traveling back to the fountain.</li>
			<li>Remember to shift+queue your Blink Dagger while you're TPing to a creep. That split second of targeting
				your Blink after you teleport in could get you killed.</li>
			<li>You probably want to have your auto-attack setting on 'Never' when playing Tinker. This reduces your chances
				of revealing yourself in trees with an errant auto attack onto a nearby lane creep.
			<ul><li>You can also get in the habit of shift+queueing a stop command after Blinking into trees.</li></ul>
			<li>Using Soul Ring will always give you a surplus mana buffer, even if your mana is full. So don't use Soul
				Ring before you TP out of the fountain because the Keen Conveyance mana cost will be taken out of the buffer.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of the few seconds of residual fountain aura when you TP to a creep. If you're fast, you
				should be able to use a Bottle charge and have it replenished immediately and you should be able to
				lose minimal HP from Soul Ring's Sacrifice.</li>
			<li>Don't make life hard for your carry. You have the ability to be in all three lanes whenever you want, but
				you also have the ability to bail at a moment's notice. Much like Nature's Prophet with his Teleportation, Tinker's job is to
				farm the dangerous locations on the map that other heroes can't. So stay out of the lane that your carry is trying
				to farm.</li>
			<li>Try and fake Keen Conveyance on nearby targets to scare enemies off chasing your allies even when you don't want to commit.</li>
			<li>If you target Keen Conveyance on an invisible ally, enemies will see your TP silhouette on wherever the ally was when you initiated
				the TP. The silhouette won't dynamically update its position, however, it'll visually stay at that initial point until your TP completes.</li>
			<li>You can target Keen Conveyance onto an ally Underlord's Fiend's Gate.</li>
			<li>You cannot target Keen Conveyance onto an ally <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Summons#Wards_Summon_Sources">ward units</a>
				(like Venomancer's Plague Wards or Clockwerk's Power Cogs).</li>
			<li>You can activate a Shiva's Guard while TPing. It takes ~2 seconds for the Blast to fully extend, so cast it
				after the first second of a TP channel to arrive with an expanded Blast.</li>
			<li>Shiva's Guard provides flying vision as it expands. If you're having trouble catching slippery enemies,
				consider picking up a Shiva's for the vision.</li>
			<li>Dagon can instakill most enemy illusions, but not 'strong' illusions like Chaos Knight's Phantasm illusions or Vengeful Spirit's Agh's Scepter
				Vengeance illusion.</li>
			<li>In late game situations, remember that Glyph provides invulnerability on your creeps when used. If you need to TP
				into a fight or want to bait an enemy into attempting to kill a creep, you could use Glyph offensively to save the creep.</li>
			<li>Rearm will refresh cooldowns for backpacked items, but you can't use Rearm to bypass the backpack-to-active-inventory cooldown.</li>
			<li>You cannot Rearm the following items: Aeon Disk, Arcane Boots, Black King Bar, Hand of Midas, Helm of the Dominator/Overlord, Linken's Sphere,
				Meteor Hammer, Pipe of Insight, Refresher Orb/Shard, or any neutral items.</li>
			<li>Rearm grants bonus magic resistance as soon as the channel starts. If you think you're about to die, it may be worth casting and immediately canceling
				Rearm just to get the bonus magic resistance.</li>
			<li>Rubick can't steal Rearm.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Warp Flare roots enemies allowing you to cancel TPs.</li>
			<li>Harpoon's projectile cannot be disjointed. However, you can Blink during the Harpoon pull. So, if you see someone trying to Harpoon you, wait until
				<i>after</i> the projectile connects before Blinking.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For some reason, lane creeps drop aggro off of an enemy creep if there is a someone
				TPing onto it. So it's up to you to kill the creep to prevent Tinker's TP.</li>
			<li>Certain abilities can instakill creeps even if they're Glyphed. These include: Doom's Devour, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Night Stalker's
				Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night, Pudge's Meat Hook, Hand of Midas, and Dagon. These can be handy to remember in a late game situation
				if Tinker Glyphs a creep wave while traveling on to it.</li>
			<li>Laser's blind can be dispelled off. Or just get BKB or MKB to mitigate the blind.</li>
			<li>The Defense Matrix buff can be removed off enemies with basic dispels.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb can be invaluable against the mostly single target damage and control builds a lot of Tinkers go for.</li>
			<li>Harpoon's active is undisjointable. So if you toss the 'poon at Tinker before he Blinks, the projectile will still follow him and drag
				him to you.</li>
			<li><i>"Ooh! They never miss!"</i> Tinker is a filthy liar. Heat-Seeking Missiles miss. A lot. Ways to make them miss include: Any kind of
				Blinking, any kind of invisibling (including Smoke), any kind of banishing, and any kind of teleporting. This spell gets more
				disjointed than an old lady falling down the stairs, which begs the question as to why Tinker hypes their reliability.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Tinker's Agh's Shard Warp Flare projectile can be disjointed.</li>
			<li>Clockwerk can be a fairly good counter since he can get vision of Tinker in the trees with Rocket Flare and
				initiate on him from a far distance.</li>
			<li>Zeus's Agh's Scepter Nimbus is basically a global instant stun. That's pretty value against a Tinker.</li>
			<li>You can consider Dominating a Harpy Scout and flying it over treelines to potentially give vision of an unwitting Tinker.</li>
			<li>Remember that unlike most TPs, Keen Conveyance is a spell. As a result, silences can cancel Tinker's Keen Conveyance TP.</li>
