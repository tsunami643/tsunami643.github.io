		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Laser deals pure damage, but does not go through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Laser's 100% blind is a big deal. Early game, you can keep it in your pocket for when a right click hero
				dives you. Once maxed, it lasts about as long as a Halberd disarm.</li>
			<li>Laser's blind works on Rosh.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Agh's Scepter Shrink Ray debuff on Laser is linked to the blind debuff and will last
				the same amount of time.</li>
			<li>The Defense Matrix buff is removed as soon as the damage threshold is reached. You won't keep the status resistance buff
				even if there was time left on the Matrix.</li>
			<li>Avoid drying yourself out of mana every time you TP on the lane in the late game. Keep mana in the bank to deal
				with a Rearm or TP getting broken. At the very least, keep your Soul Ring off CD whenever you're
				traveling back to the fountain.</li>
			<li>Remember to shift+queue your Blink Dagger while you're TPing to a creep. That split second of targeting
				your Blink after you teleport in could get you killed.</li>
			<li>You probably want to have your auto-attack setting on 'Never' when playing Tinker. This reduces your chances
				of revealing yourself in trees with an errant right click.</li>
			<li>You can also get in the habit of shift+queueing a stop command after Blinking into trees.</li>
			<li>Using Soul Ring will always give you a +150 mana buffer, even if your mana is filled. So don't use Soul
				Ring before you TP out of the fountain otherwise the Keen Conveyance mana cost will be taken out of the buffer.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of the few seconds of residual fountain aura when you TP to a creep. If you're fast, you
				should be able to use a Bottle charge and have it replenished immediately, and you should be able to
				lose minimal HP from Soul Ring's Sacrifice.</li>
			<li>Don't make life hard for your carry. You have the ability to be in all three lanes whenever you want, but
				you also have the ability to bail at a moment's notice. Much like Nature's Prophet, Tinker's job is to
				farm the dangerous locations on the map that other heroes can't. So stay out of the lane that your carry is trying
				to farm.</li>
			<li>Use fake TPs to scare enemies off chasing your allies even when you don't want to commit.</li>
			<li>Keen Conveyance will be canceled if the target you're traveling on gets banished. Even things like Manta Style's activation banish
				can interrupt your teleport.</li>
			<li>You can activate a Shiva's Guard while TPing. It takes ~2.5 seconds for the Blast to fully extend, so cast it
				after the first second of a TP channel to arrive with an expanded Blast.</li>
			<li>Shiva's Guard provides flying vision as it expands. If you're having trouble catching slippery enemies,
				consider picking up a Shiva's for the vision.</li>
			<li>Dagon can instakill most enemy illusions, but not 'strong' illusions like Chaos Knight's Phantasm illusions or Vengeful Spirit's Agh's Scepter
				Vengeance illusion.</li>
			<li>In late game situations, remember that Glyph provides invulnerability on your creeps when used. If you need to TP
				into a fight or want to bait an enemy into attempting to kill a creep, you could use Glyph offensively to save the creep.</li>
			<li>Rearm will refresh cooldowns for backpacked items, but you can't use Rearm to bypass the backpack-to-active-inventory cooldown.</li>
			<li>You cannot Rearm the following items: Aeon Disk, Arcane Boots, Black King Bar, Hand of Midas, Helm of the Dominator/Overlord, Linken's Sphere,
				Meteor Hammer, Pipe of Insight, Refresher Orb/Shard, or any neutral items.</li>
			<li>Rubick can't steal Rearm.</li>
			<li>Arcane Blink does <i>not</i> reduce channel times, only cast animation times. You still have to wait for the full Rearm channel even with Arcane Blink.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Warp Flare does not behave as a stun and does not break channels. It's more like an instant Hurricane Pike
				in terms of mechanics.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For some reason, lane creeps drop aggro off of an enemy creep if there is a someone
				TPing onto it. So it's up to you to kill the creep to prevent Tinker's TP.</li>
			<li>Dominating or banishing a unit will cancel any TP channels on that unit.</li>
			<li>Laser's Blind can be purged off. Or just get BKB or MKB to mitigate the Blind.</li>
			<li>The Defense Matrix buff can be purged off enemies.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb can be invaluable against the mostly single target damage and control builds a lot of Tinkers go for.</li>
			<li>Tinker is a filthy liar. Heat-Seeking Missiles miss. A lot. Ways to make them miss include: Any kind of
				Blinking, any kind of invisibling (including Smoke), any kind of banishing, any kind of teleporting, and any
				kind of spell immunity. This spell gets more disjointed than an old lady falling down the stairs, which begs
				the question as to why Tinker hypes their reliability.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>The Warp Flare projectile can be disjointed.</li>
			<li>Clockwerk is also a fairly good counter since he can get vision of Tinker in the trees with Rocket Flare and
				initiate on him from a far distance.</li>
			<li>Zeus's Agh's Scepter Nimbus is basically a global instant stun. That's pretty value against a Tinker.</li>
			<li>You can place wards on the outer cliff perimeter of the map. This gives vision above the trees that
				Tinkers typically Blink into.</li>
			<li>You can consider Dominating a Harpy Scout and flying it over treelines to potentially catch an unwitting Tinker.</li>
			<li>Silences can cancel Tinker's Keen Conveyance TP.</li>
