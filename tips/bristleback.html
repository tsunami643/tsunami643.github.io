		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're against heroes with global skills (AA, Invoker, Zeus), be sure to face in the inside of your
				Fountain when healing to take advantage the Bristleback passive.</li>
			<li>Bristleback damage reduction does <i>not</i> work on towers.</li>
			<li>Spam spells to keep Warpath stacks up when roaming around the map if you have the mana regen to support
				it.</li>
			<li>Spam Quills in the fountain before TPing out to charge up Warpath stacks.</li>
			<li>A highly effective hero to take advantage of stacked ancients with. By the time you get a Vanguard you
				should be able to take a three stack of ancients literally without even looking.</li>
			<li>Bristle is tied for the fastest turn rate in the game. If you're laning against a ranged hero with a
				slow projectile, you should absolutely take advantage of this by gracefully pirouetting before every
				right click harass attempt.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bristleback damage reduction is calculated based on his orientation to the hero who
				<a href="http://howdoiplay.com/herotips_files/bristleback.webm"><i>owns</i> the source of damage he's
																							taking.</a> Summons deal
				damage based on their own position, not the hero who summoned them.</li>
			<li>Magic Wand is core against this guy ALL GAME LONG. Unlike other heroes who stop spamming once the laning
				phase ends like Batrider or Zeus, Bristle needs to mash his spells for the whole game. No matter what
				role you're playing, you should always get a wand or a stick.</li>
			<li>Quill Spray is physical damage, so if you get a Ghost Scepter this guy can't do anything except wipe his
				nose on you.</li>
			<li>Quill Spray is not reduced by damage block, so building a Crimson Guard against Bristleback won't help
				you as much as you'd hope.</li>
			<li>You can purge Goo stacks (Manta, Eul's, Diffusal, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves).</li>
			<li>Bristle is all about whittling down your armor and barraging you with physical damage. Stacking armor
				helps mitigate his damage output (Shiva's, AC, even a Basi ring is good).</li>
			<li>The only ways to completely shut off his passive Bristleback is with Agh Doom, Agh Shadow Demon, or
				Silver Edge.</li>
			<li>Razor makes Bristleback's life incredibly hard. Bristle can't go on Razor thanks to Unstable Current
				slowing him every time he casts Goo and Bristle has no easy way to stop Razor from slurping up his
				damage with Static Link.</li>
