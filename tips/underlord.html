		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enemies don't see your Firestorm or Pit of Malice indicators during the cast animation.
				The only person you're mindgaming is yourself.</li>
			<li>Pit of Malice doesn't provide any vision by itself, but you can see its little rooty tendrils shoot
				up whenever it successfully catches a hero.
			<ul><li>You can <i>very faintly</i> see some ethereal particles shoot up whenever the Pit roots non-hero units. You can potentially
				use this on the Rosh pit to check if he's spawned, but it's super difficult to see.</li></ul>
			<li>Pit of Malice catches invisible targets and provides true sight on them whenever they're rooted.</li>
			<li>Pit of Malice doesn't root the entire AoE at fixed intervals, each unit is independently rooted
				whenever they walk in or stay in the Pit. So items that keep enemies in the AoE of Pit can be useful
				to re-root them after the delay.</li>
			<li>You don't gain Atrophy Aura damage from illusions, ward units, or Undying zombie deaths. Only heroes, creeps, or summons dying
				give you damage.</li>
			<li>Enemies can see your Fiend's Gate destination on cast on their minimap similar to an Io's Relocate.</li>
			<li>Enemy heroes can travel through your Fiend's Gate if they want to.</li>
			<li>Most summons can pass through a Fiend's Gate except for Brewmaster Brewlings and dominated/Enchantress/Chen creeps.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Gate destroys trees around both portal locations. You can theoretically use this to globally break trees that a Monkey King is Tree Dancing on
				or to free allies from a Hoodwink Bushwhack tree. You can't directly target Fiend's Gate onto a tree, but the tree breaking AoE is pretty large.</li>
			<li>If allies are at the edge of an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field, place a Fiend's Gate next to them. While channeling the Gate, they'll slightly move
				towards it and, in the process, break out of the Kinetic Field. They don't even have to finish the Gate channel, they can just walk away.</li>
			<li>If a hero has cast range buffs, they can start channeling Fiend's Gate from further away.</li>
			<li>Targets cannot travel through Fiend's Gate while rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>The "Abyssal Horde" facet tooltip is very poorly worded and confusingly programmed. Here's my understanding of how the facet works:
				<ul><li>Each time you pass through the Fiend's Gate, one Warrior and one Archer will spawn and attack a random target
					in vision in a 1200 AoE around the Gate.</li>
					<li>Alternating Warriors and Archers will spawn individually for each remaining enemy unit in a 1200 AoE around the Gate.</li>
					<li>Once each enemy unit in the AoE has been aggro'd by a Warrior or Archer, the creeps will stop spawning.</li>
					<li>If a Warrior or Archer is killed, a new one will not spawn to re-aggro the unit it was focused on. Only one spawn per enemy unit.</li>
					<li>You have to pass through the Gate to start the spawning process.</li>
					<li>No fresh creeps will ever directly spawn to attack enemy buildings. Existing creeps will only attack towers if there are no other
						targets for them to aggro onto.</li>
					<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Invading Force Movement Bonus/Damage Reduction" talent <i>does not</i> apply to "Abyssal Horde" creeps
						because they technically never teleport through the Gate, they just spawn next to it.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pit of Malice will root you even when you're invis or smoked.</li>
			<li>Atrophy Aura reduces base attack damage, but not raw (+green) damage items or talents.
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Break">Break</a> disables Atrophy Aura's damage reduction.
			</li>
			<li>Illusions of Underlord will carry their own Atrophy Aura. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take advantage of this.
			</li>
			<li>You can travel through an enemy Underlord's Fiend's Gate.</li>
			<li>Targets cannot travel through Fiend's Gate while rooted/leashed.</li>
