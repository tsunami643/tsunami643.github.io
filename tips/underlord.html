		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enemies don't see your Firestorm or Pit of Malice indicators during the cast animation.
				The only person you're mindgaming is yourself.</li>
			<li>Pit of Malice doesn't provide any vision by itself, but you can see its little rooty tendrils shoot
				up whenever it successfully catches a hero.</li>
			<li>You can <i>very faintly</i> see some ethereal particles shoot up whenever the Pit roots non-hero units. You can potentially
				use this on the Rosh pit to check if he's spawned, but it's difficult to see.</li>
			<li>Pit of Malice catches invisible targets and provides true sight on them whenever they're rooted.</li>
			<li>Pit of Malice doesn't root the entire AoE at fixed intervals, each unit is independently rooted
				whenever they walk in or stay in the Pit. So items that keep enemies in the AoE of Pit can be useful
				to re-root them after the delay.</li>
			<li>You don't gain Atrophy Aura damage from illusions, ward units, or Undying zombie deaths. Only heroes, creeps, or summons dying
				give you damage.</li>
			<li>Fun fact: Enemy summons timing out actually <i>do</i> add to your Atrophy Aura.</li>
			<li>Heroes that are banished or cycloned will still travel through your Dark Rift as long as they're in the AoE.
				In fact, cycloning yourself as Underlord during the delay is a popular tactic to help guarantee a smooth Rift.</li>
			<li>Anything you can Boots of Travel to, you can Dark Rift to. Actually, all the mechanics for Boots of Travel
				targeting are the same as Dark Rift targeting.</li>
			<li>Dark Rift will teleport creep-heroes, like Warlock's Golem or Visage Familiars.</li>
			<li>Unlike Io's Relocate, enemies won't see a TP indicator on their minimap when you Dark Rift. However, they
				can see the Rift effect on whatever unit you've targeted if they have vision.</li>
			<li>Dark Rift's teleport doesn't interrupt self or ally channels.</li>
			<li>That means you can Dark Rift while channeling an Outpost and complete the channel after you Rift out.</li>
			<li>When Underlord first came out everyone thought they were geniuses by TPing to an ally during the Rift delay
				for some sick drive-by escape Rifts. This is still possible, especially with Boots of Travel 2s, but the delay on Rift is
				just way too high to make it reliable.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pit of Malice will root you even when you're invis or smoked.</li>
			<li>Atrophy Aura reduces base attack damage, but not raw (green) damage items or talents.
			</li>
			<li>Break disables Atrophy Aura's damage reduction.
			</li>
			<li>Illusions of Underlord will carry their own Atrophy Aura. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take advantage of this.
			</li>
			<li>If you think you're hot stuff, you can try using repositioning spells, like Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap or Kunkka's X Marks the Spot, Disruptor's Glimpse,
				or items, like Force Staff, to try and interfere with the number of passengers escaping in Underlord's Dark Rift.
				It's harder than it sounds since there is no reliable way to time when the Rift delay is ending other than the audio cue.</li>
