		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>It's extremely easy to time Swarm casts during pushes. Just look at the mirror lane on your side of the
				map and see where your creeps are. If they're about to get into tower range, cast Swarm.</li>
			<li>Swarm has a ridiculous amount of range. The bugs travel 3000 units, making it a choice spell for
				scouting Rosh attempts or finding people hiding in the jungle.</li>
			<li>Hurricane Pike can be a cute pickup on Weaver since you can Swarm an enemy, Pike them,
				and still have the bugs keeping vision of your target no matter how far you are.</li>
			<li>Swarm bugs draw tower aggro, making it a smart choice to Swarm someone before diving them.</li>
			<li>If you cast Swarm on a siege creep, it will immediately lose interest in the tower it's attacking
				and aggro your beetle instead.</li>
			<li>Swarm bugs work on Rosh.</li>
			<li>Swarm bugs persist on enemies even if they get cycloned or banished.</li>
			<li>Like with other invis skills, you can cast Shukuchi while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>If you're chasing someone down, don't break Shukuchi immediately after passing through them. Use the
				remainder of the bonus speed to walk in front of them before you start attacking.</li>
			<li>Practice landing last hits off of the Geminated attack, rather than the initial one. If you're having
				trouble with the projectile timing, just stand right next to the creep and it'll feel like you have
				double damage. If you don't need help last hitting, use Geminate procs exclusively for harassing
				enemies.</li>
			<li>Geminate Attack procs on all enemy ward units. This makes Weaver effective against things like Undying's Tombstone,
				Pugna's Nether Ward, Phoenix's Supernova, Gyrocopter's Homing Missile, or Clockwerk's Power Cogs.</li>
			<li>Manually casting Geminate Attack on an enemy hero will not draw aggro from creeps.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Geminate Attacks won't carry any attack modifiers from items.</li>
			<li>Time Lapse <i>before</i> casting Shukuchi. This is like the biggest mistake beginner Weavers make since they'll
				quickly realize they got all their HP back, but now their escape spell is on cooldown.</li>
			<li>That being said, Time Lapse <i>does</i> have a cast time, Shukuchi does not. If you're confident that the enemy has no
				detection or AoE spells to finish you off, just Shukuchi out.</li>
			<li>Use Time Lapse liberally in lane. This isn't Wraith King's Reincarnation, Time Lapse only has around a minute cooldown early on.</li>
			<li>You can even TP back to base, do some quick shopping/pick up a Salve or Clarity, then Time Lapse to come back to the 
				lane.</li>
			<li>Time doesn't tick down for Time Lapse even if you're dead. You can Time Lapse the moment you spawn after
				being dead for 40 seconds and show up to where you were 5 seconds before you died.</li>
			<li>This ties into the whole 'buyback insta-Time Lapse' tactic. It's a dangerously cheesy strategy, but it
				works sometimes.</li>
			<li>Time Lapse HP gain will work even if you're Ancient Apparition Ice Blasted.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Time Lapsing an ally won't break their channels. Useful for cheese strats with an Enigma or Witch Doctor,
				or if you're just trying to save someone who's TPing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to use Dust after he Shukuchis. This way Weaver has to either instantly Time Lapse to dispel the dust
				and be Shukuchi-less or he'll have to escape while being dusted.</li>
			<li>Raindrops can significantly reduce the damage you'll take from Weaver Shukuchis in lane.</li>
			<li>Try not to reveal you have a sentry ward in lane. Weavers Shukuchi deeeeep into creep waves whenever
				they're trying to get the nuke damage, but they won't do that if they know you have detection. Let
				Weaver get complacent before you try to go for a kill.</li>
			<li>It takes 4 hits from a hero to shake a Swarm bug off you.</li>
			<li>You may need to pick heroes with cheap Linken's breakers or good silences when drafting against Weaver. Or build 
				disabling items like Orchid, Abyssal, or Scythe of Vyse.</li>
