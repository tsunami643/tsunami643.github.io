		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Static Remnants give you flying vision around their cast point. Use this to find people trying to juke in the trees,
				scout Rosh, or check an area before going up hill.</li>
			<li>Remnants last 12 seconds each so it's not a bad idea to set some up if you're afraid a Riki or smoked hero is
				trailing you since they'll detonate and damage on invis units.</li>
			<li>You can drop a Static Remnant on an Aegis carrier's tombstone to prevent them from Blinking out since
				the Remnant will detonate as soon as the enemy respawns.</li>
			<li>You can Overload an auto attack while it's in the air. If you just tossed a long range auto attack on a
				target, you can cast a Remnant or Ball real quick and the attack will hit Overloaded.</li>
			<li>Cast a spell in the fountain or throw up a quick Remnant once you reach your destination if you're going
				to be TPing to a tower. Or use a spell before activating an invis rune. Get your free Overload.</li>
			<li>You can use items while in Ball Lightning, like Orchid. You can begin channeling a TP while flying. You
				can cast spells like Remnant or Electric Vortex while flying. You can even pick up runes that are along
				your path while in Ball Lightning. You can activate runes and use Bottle while in Ball. You can also pick up items.
				<i>Like an Aegis, perhaps.</i></li>
			<li>Storm will immediately perform the next action you ordered once you come out of Ball Lightning. If there is
				no action (like a right click on the enemy hero), he'll just auto attack the nearest thing if Auto Attack is set to 'Standard'.
				This can be irritating when you're Balling long distances or into fogged vision because he'll inevitably blow an Overload
				charge on a creep. To avoid this, hit the stop key while you're flying and he'll do nothing when he lands.</li>
			<li>Avoid making multiple short trips when you're escaping and Balling on a mana budget. Do one long trip.
				There's no reason to have to pay the ignition cost of Ball Lightning multiple times if you have one
				destination.</li>
			<li>You can cast a 0 range Ball Lightning by clicking your hero portrait when targeting Ball.</li>
			<li>You are completely invincible while in Ball Lightning, so brush up on your jukenomics. Besides using the
				invincibility to dodge things, spells like Rupture won't affect you when you're traveling
				and you can even fly through a Chronosphere without getting locked.</li>
			<li>Since you are untargetable while in Ball Lightning, you can cast items like Orchid on a target with Lotus Orb
				and not worry about it getting reflected back. You can also avoid a reflected Electric Vortex, but you have to target Ball Lightning
				far enough away that the 0.3s cast animation of Vortex takes place while you're still in Ball Lightning.
			</li>
			<li>If you need to chain Ball Lightning casts as quickly as possible, you need to try and time your 0.3s Ball Lightning cast
				animation when you're slightly less than 0.3s away from ending the first Ball Lightning. This is mainly relevant
				during level 25 "Auto-Remnant" talent base defenses where you need to shoot out of your base and return back as safely as possible.
			</li>
			<li>Arcane Rune and Kaya reduce all aspects of Ball Lightning's mana costs (both the initial jump and travel cost).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shut his mouth. Silences and most other disables irritate Storm. The more time he
				has to spend walking around with Underloaded right clicks, the less happy he is.</li>
			<li>Break his ankles. Like most other heroes with a Blink, Storms will overshoot Ball Lightning down the
				path that they think you're traveling so they can get in more right clicks. If you're escaping out of
				his auto attack range during a gank, as soon as he starts Balling towards you, turn around and move to
				where he just was. He'll either have to Ball again or slowly walk to come back.</li>
			<li>Tie him up. Storm can't cast Ball Lightning when rooted. Heroes with roots/leashes are obviously great,
				but don't forget about Rod of Atos.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter is an underrated item against Storm. Yes, most of his damage is magic, but he actually has
				to right click on you to deal it.</li>
