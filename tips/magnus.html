		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shockwave's forced movement can't cancel enemy channels, but can take enemies out of Shadow Amulet or
				take Templar Assassin out of Meld.</li>
			<li>Ranged allies still benefit from Empower bonus damage. You can't give Windranger cleavage, but
				I'm sure she won't mind the extra damage.</li>
			<li>Empower only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not +damage items.</li>
			<li>Skewer only goes as far as you click if you're not maxing out the range. I know you're really excited
				that you actually landed a 3-man RP, now just pan the camera a bit and you've got it made.</li>
			<li>No one is forcing you to use Skewer to drag enemies all willy nilly. You can also use it at close range
				mid-gank to inject enemies with the movespeed slow from your horn or use it to destroy a treeline to help your team close a
				gap.</li>
			<li>When Skewering to escape, don't freaking carpool with the people who are ganking you. It's smart to go
				past cliffs with Skewer, but it's dumb if you're bringing the enemy with you. Choose a Skewer
				destination that is not only far, but also at an angle that won't drag undesirables along for the ride.</li>
			<li>By default, your team of random pubs will generally assume that you're not going to Skewer after a good
				Reverse Polarity. It's worth sacrificing the positional benefit from Skewer just to make sure you're not
				causing your teammates to whiff their spells on where they thought the enemies would be.</li>
			<li>Keep your finger primed on the stop key when you're initiating or ganking. It's pretty easy to tell when
				you're about to whiff your RP, so be prepared to cancel your cast.</li>
			<li>After you Blink into the enemy team, right click behind you as you cast RP. This'll get Magnus to rotate
				as you're casting RP and all the enemies get stunned at the desired Skewer angle without you having to
				run around behind them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Magnus cannot Skewer when rooted.</li>
			<li>When you're mid against Mag, it's obvious when he's trying to push the lane so that he can get the rune.
				He's going to auto attack all the creeps a bit and then he's going to Shockwave at a very predictable
				angle. There isn't much you can do to stop this (other than harassing him hard), but at least don't get
				hit by the Shockwave. It wasn't even meant for you.</li>
			<li>Reverse Polarity is one of those skill cooldowns that's worth keeping track of, mainly because it's a stupidly
				powerful ult, but also because it has a pretty easy to remember cooldown of ~2 minutes.</li>
