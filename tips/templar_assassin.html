		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get consumed on denial attacks, but you also don't
				get the bonus damage when attacking allies.</li>
			<li>All damage sources are created equal on the temple steps. Whether it's a ranged creep, a tower shot, or
				a thousand damage Phantom Assassin crit, each instance of damage you take will wipe a Refraction charge off. As a TA, it's
				massively important to learn how to maintain creep aggro to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction
				charges.</li>
			<li>Since the entire damage instance is blocked, Refraction prevents Blink Dagger or consumable regen from breaking if
				you get hit.</li>
			<li>The cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team
				fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one
				up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.</li>
			<li>Meld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right
				clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of
				high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a
				split-second of fog.</li>
			<li>You have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.</li>
			<li>If you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using attack move commands instead of
				right clicking on the enemy.</li>
			<li>The armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh. The debuff stacks as well, so you should try to double-Meld Rosh
				when you first start taking it.</li>
			<li>Melding a unit makes your Psi Blades deal more damage on spill targets since the primary unit will have reduced armor.</li>
			<li>To be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi Blades like a concert pianist. A deny
				could be used to pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two
				spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect
				spills.</li>
			<li>Psi Blade's spill angle is calculated from TA's position once the attack connects, not from where
				TA was when the attack was started. It's not much, but you can ever so slightly move yourself around after
				you attack to change spill angles onto the enemy.</li>
			<li>Spill damage can hit invisible units and couriers.</li>
			<li>You can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps
				themselves. However, please notify your teammates that you're doing this otherwise you're going to
				sabotage their micro.</li>
			<li>The core early game Trap locations are the runes (or one rune), their side of the mid hill, your side of the mid hill,
				Rosh, and choke points on stairs.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/an7iw5/there_are_blind_spots_in_rosh_pit_where_you_cant/">There are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the
				Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it.</a> You can use this to potentially hide Psionic Traps from a casual sweep of the pit.</li>
			<li>Damage from multiple Traps won't stack.</li>
			<li>The last Trap debuff an enemy is hit by will immediately overwrite the previous Trap debuff (for both the slow and damage).</li>
			<li>If you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Psionic Trap damage. Be sure to account
				for the Trap slow affecting the neutrals with your stack timings.</li>
			<li>If you're close to messing up a stack, try using a Trap to slow down the neutrals before they make it back
				to the camp.</li>
			<li>You can use Trap damage on lane creeps to split push lanes.</li>
			<li>The "Meld Hit Bash" talent can stun enemies through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>TA is an excellent hero to learn Tread switching on since she can make use of all three attributes
				and frequently gets a Bottle.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If TA has the damage buff from Refraction, her Psi Blades will be longer and glow redder.
				Personally, I can't tell the difference and I don't have the time to color match it at Home Depot when
				I'm dying under my tower, but it's true.</li>
			<li>DoT her Refraction. Venomancer, Viper, Radiance, etc. Spells that deal lots of instances of damage like
				Kunkka's Torrent, Grimstroke's Ink Swell, Pudge's Rot, Sand King's Sandstorm, or Slark's Dark Pact are good too.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows can also break TA's Refraction, but it only ticks once every ~0.5s.</li>
			<li>Certain spells that add damage instances on right clicks, like Clinkz's Searing Arrows, can burn off
				two Refraction charges in one attack. Items with procs like Maelstrom or MKB also work.</li>
			<li>You can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration undispellable buff,
				not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted spells or detection otherwise she'll just sit
				there until her Blink comes off cooldown.</li>
			<li>However, spells that change her position like Batrider's Flamebreak, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Dark Seer's Vacuum, Drow Ranger's Gust, Earthshaker's Fissure,
				Invoker's Deafening Blast, Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, Magnus's Skewer, Mars's Spear, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge,
				or Void Spirit's Aether Remnant can break Meld by moving her.</li>
			<li>Know what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you
				have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?</li>
			<li>Always be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy
				trying to spill on you.</li>
			<li>If you activate Glyph, Psi Blades can't Spill any damage off of your creeps. Could be handy to know in a
				low HP mid lane skirmish situation.</li>
			<li>If you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 5 minutes. Not only will this allow you to
				actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that
				you know she has on your side of the hill.</li>
			<li>Smokes are great against teams with a TA since they will often be lazy when spamming observer wards if
				they can rely on Trap vision. On the other hand, you need to be careful that you're not Smoking on top
				of a Trap.</li>
			<li>She almost definitely has a Trap in the Rosh pit, so either bring sentries or don't go for sneaky Rosh
				attempts against a TA.</li>
