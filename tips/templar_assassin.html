		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get consumed on denial attacks, but you also don't
				get the bonus damage when issuing deny attacks.</li>
			<li>All damage sources are created equal on the temple steps. Whether it's a ranged creep, a tower shot, or
				a thousand damage Phantom Assassin crit, each instance of damage you take will wipe a Refraction charge off. As a TA, it's
				massively important to learn how to maintain creep aggro to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction
				charges.</li>
			<li>Since the entire damage instance is blocked, Refraction prevents Blink Dagger or consumable regen from breaking if
				you get hit.</li>
			<li>The cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team
				fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one
				up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.</li>
			<li>Meld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right
				clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of
				high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a
				split-second of fog. Chances are the enemy will assume you kept running and continue chasing the same direction.</li>
			<li>You have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.</li>
			<li>If you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using attack+move commands instead of
				right clicking on the enemy.</li>
			<li>The armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh. The debuff stacks as well, so you should try to double-Meld Rosh
				when you first start taking it.</li>
			<li>Melding a unit makes your Psi Blades deal more damage on spill targets since the primary unit will have reduced armor.</li>
			<li>To be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi Blades like a concert pianist. A deny
				could be used to pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two
				spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect
				spills.</li>
			<li>Psi Blade's spill angle is calculated from TA's position once the attack connects, not from where
				TA was when the attack was started. It's not much, but you can ever so slightly move yourself around after
				you attack to change spill angles onto the enemy.</li>
			<li>You can target your Traps with deny attacks to give a target to spill off of. If an enemy is escaping out of your attack range or vision, try planting a
				Trap in a line behind them and immediately deny it to potentially spill onto the enemy.</li>
			<li>Psi Blade spill damage can hit ethereal units.</li>
			<li>Psi Blade spill damage can hit invisible units.</li>
			<li>Psi Blade damage can spill through Venomancer's Plague Wards and Techies' Proximity Mines, but not any other types of ward units (other than your Traps).
				Probably because other ward units require a number of attacks to kill, but these have actual HP.</li>
			<li>You can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps
				themselves by opening the scoreboard and clicking the "Shared Unit Control Options" icon in the bottom corner. Please notify your teammates that you're doing this
				otherwise you're going to sabotage their micro.</li>
			<li>The core early game Trap locations are the runes (or at least one rune), their side of the mid hill, your side of the mid hill,
				and choke points on stairs. Mid/late game should include Traps on the Twin Gates and the Rosh pits.</li>
			<li><a href="https://youtu.be/G7W3VhXu0JY?t=22">There are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the
				Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it.</a> You can use this to potentially hide Psionic Traps from a casual sweep of the pit.</li>
			<li>Damage from multiple Traps won't stack.</li>
			<li>The last Trap debuff an enemy is hit by will immediately overwrite the previous Trap debuff (for both the slow and damage).</li>
			<li>If you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Psionic Trap damage. Be sure to account
				for the Trap slow affecting the neutrals with your stack timings.</li>
			<li>If you're close to messing up a stack, try using a Trap to slow down the neutrals before they make it back
				inside their spawn box.</li>
			<li>You can use Trap damage on lane creeps to split push lanes.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Meld Hit Bash" talent can stun enemies through debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>TA is an excellent hero to learn Tread switching on since she can make use of all three attributes
				and frequently gets a Bottle.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If TA has the damage buff from Refraction, her Psi Blades will be longer and glow redder.
				Personally, I can't tell the difference and I don't have the time to color match it at Home Depot when
				I'm dying under my tower, but it's true.</li>
			<li>Damage over time is great at burning off her defensive Refraction charges. Batrider, Jakiro, Phoenix, Venomancer, and Viper
				are examples of heroes with spells that are great at quickly burning off Refraction.
			<ul><li>Items that apply DoTs like Blood Grenade, Urn of Shadows/Spirit Vessel, and Radiance can also slowly take Refraction instances off.</li></ul>
			<li>Spells that quickly deal lots of little instances of damage like Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Ember Spirit's Flame Guard, Kunkka's Torrent,
				Grimstroke's Ink Swell, Nature's Prophet's Sprout, Pudge's Rot, Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave, Razor's Eye of the Storm, Sand King's Sandstorm, Slark's Dark Pact,
				or Bloodseeker's Agh's Scepter Blood Mist are also good at rapidly shredding Refraction instances.</li>
			<li>Certain spells that add seperate damage instances on right clicks, like Enchantress's Impetus or Spectre's Desolate,
				can burn off two Refraction charges in one attack. Items with procs like Maelstrom or MKB also work. Diffusal Blade does <i>not</i>
				add a separate damage instance.</li>
			<li>Illusion heroes (like Chaos Knight, Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer, and Terrorblade) are good at dealing with Refraction since each illusion's attack will remove a Refraction charge.</li>
			<li>You can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration undispellable buff,
				not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted spells or detection (Dust or sentry wards), otherwise she'll just sit
				there until her Blink comes off cooldown.
			<ul><li>However, spells that change her horizontal position with <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Forced_Movement">forced movement</a> like
				Batrider's Flamebreak, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Dark Seer's Vacuum, Drow Ranger's Gust, Invoker's Deafening Blast,
				Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, Magnus's Skewer, Mars's Spear, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave, Spirit Breaker's Charge,
				or Void Spirit's Aether Remnant can break Meld by moving her.</li></ul>
			<li>Know what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you
				have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?</li>
			<li>Always be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy
				trying to spill on you.</li>
			<li>If you activate Glyph, Psi Blades can't Spill any damage off of your creeps. Could be handy to know in a
				low HP mid lane skirmish situation.</li>
			<li>If you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 5 minutes. Not only will this allow you to
				actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand and she tries to hide with Meld, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that
				you know she has on your side of the hill.
			<ul><li>If you have a spell that she can disjoint in the laning phase with Meld invisibility, it can be worth getting a sentry ward
				even earlier.
			</li></ul>
			<li>Smokes are great against teams with a TA since they will often be lazy when spamming observer wards if
				they can rely on Trap vision. On the other hand, you need to be careful that you're not Smoking on top
				of a Trap.</li>
			<li>Assume she has a Trap in pit when you're Roshing, so either bring sentries or don't go for sneaky Rosh
				attempts against a TA.
				<ul><li>Runes are also very commonly Trapped by TA, so she may see you if you're camping the rune before it spawns.</li></ul>
			<li>The "Gossamer Cape" neutral item is an incredibly valuable pickup against Templar Assassin to help evade her Meld attack.</li>
