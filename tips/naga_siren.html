		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Mirror Image can purge/dispel all the debuffs that a Manta Style would. Besides silences, obviously.</li>
			<li>Casting Mirror Image will disjoint projectiles and banish your hero for 0.3s.</li>
			<li>You can start in INT Treads and swap while in the Mirror Image delay to get your illusions to spawn with AGI treads.</li>
			<li>Illusions are not affected by backpack delay, so you don't need to wait the full cooldown to spawn them with
				a swapped backpack item.</li>
			<li>Unified move commands (look in your options to find out what the key modifier is, by default it's
				CTRL) may allow you to micro your illusions a little easier.</li>
			<li>If you really want to step up your micro, consider incorporating
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMfL9yTIIAw">'cloning' into your skill repertoire.</a></li>
			<li>Use Mirror Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes throughout the game.</li>
			<li>Learn how to use the 'patrol' command in your options. This can allow your illusions to weave in
				and out of a camp or damage two camps with Radiance using minimal micro. They'll tank less damage and farm more creeps.</li>
			<li>When defending high ground, send your illusions out one by one rather than as a group. Enemies can use AoE
				spells to take out every illusion in one fell swoop if you send them as a clump. Better yet, don't even let a single illusion
				stand around and fight the creep wave, just let it keep slithering down the lane while maintaining creep aggro. Force enemies to chase
				the Image before it shepherds their creep wave all the way back to the river.</li>
			<li>Ensnare provides true sight on an enemy if they go invis while netted.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Ensnare can target enemies who are cycloned.</li>
			<li>When chasing an enemy with an illusion, consider using a move command on the target as opposed to attacking the target. It'll stick closer
				to your victim since it won't waste time in attack animations and you can build up Rip Tide stacks with your hero elsewhere on the map.</li>
			<li>Avoid completely drying out your mana in the early game. Song+TP will allow you to escape most gank situations, but only
				if you have the mana available for both.</li>
			<li>If you aren't partied up in a 5 stack, just use your ult defensively. <i>"Buuuut moooom, all the other
				heroes get to press R in a team fight." "Maybe when you're older, Slithice. Why can't you be like that
				nice boy Terrorblade and use your ult situationally?"</i></li>
			<li>You didn't listen to me, did you. You used it. See, Naga, this is why we can't trust you... Now look.
				Everyone is shuffling around awkwardly on your team because they're both seething with rage and because
				they can't tell if you want to commit to this failed fight or not. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Just press R
				again. Yeah that's right, you can cancel your ult. You can just act like it was a misclick.</li>
			<li>Supposing you <i>do</i> have a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some useful
				synergies:
				<ul><li><b>Dark Seer</b> - Vacuum can reposition sleeping units.
					<li><b>Razor</b> - Song doesn't stop Static Link.
					<li><b>Undying</b> - Zombies continue to spawn on sleeping enemies.
					<li><b>Warlock</b> - Channel a fat Upheaval during the Song.
					<li><b>Weaver</b> - Swarm bugs can latch on sleeping units, but won't reduce armor.
				</ul>
				</li>
			<li>If an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out,
				you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the debuff immune enemy.</li>
			<li>Enemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't. This allows you to get
				uncontestable and rage inducing denies on towers.</li>
			<li>If you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin
				channeling your TP.</li>
			<li>There aren't many situations in which you want to use all 7 seconds of your ult. If you catch someone
				out with it, cancel it as soon as teammates are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more
				time to save them or letting the hero get their cooldowns back.</li>
			<li>Roshan is deaf and Song does not affect him. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish
				Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.</li>
			<li>Comboing Song into Meteor Hammer is easier than you'd think. Don't bother timing it manually, just use shift
				queueing. Activate Song, cast Meteor Hammer, and shift+queue Song End while Hammer is channeling.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be wary of activating any sort of debuff immunity (like from BKB) before Naga uses Song, otherwise Naga may just sleep all your teammates
				while you're fighting debuff immune alone.</li>
			<li>Because Naga spawns one "tick" before her illusions from a Mirror Image, you can attack+move before she Mirror Images
				and you'll always attack the real hero after she comes back.</li>
			<li>Ensnare is dispellable. This makes items like Guardian Greaves, Satanic, Eul's, Lotus Orb, or Manta Style useful to have.</li>
			<li>Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Pugna's Life Drain, Lion's Mana Drain, Disruptor's Glimpse, and any Hex.</li>
			<li>Other heroes with spells that are useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.</li>
