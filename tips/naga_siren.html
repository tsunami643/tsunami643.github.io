		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Mirror Image can purge all the debuffs that a Manta would. Besides silences, obviously.</li>
			<li>Casting Mirror Image will disjoint projectiles and banish your hero for 0.3s.</li>
			<li>You can start in INT Treads and swap while in the Mirror Image delay to get your illusions to spawn with AGI treads.</li>
			<li>Illusions are not affected by backpack delay, so you don't need to wait the full cooldown to spawn them with
				a swapped backpack item.</li>
			<li>Unified move commands (look in your options to find out what the key modifier is, by default it's
				CTRL) may allow you to micro your illusions a little easier.</li>
			<li>If you really want to step up your micro, consider incorporating
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMfL9yTIIAw">'cloning' into your skill repertoire.</a></li>
			<li>Learn how to use the 'patrol' command in your options. This can allow your illusions to weave in
				and out of a camp or damage two camps with Radiance using minimal micro. They'll tank less damage and farm more creeps.</li>
			<li>When defending high ground, send your illusions out one by one rather than as a group. Enemies can use AoE
				spells to take out every illusion in one fell swoop if you send them as a clump. Instead, force them to chase each
				Image individually.</li>
			<li>Ensnare provides true sight on an enemy if they go invis while netted.</li>
			<li>Avoid completely drying out your mana in the early game. Song+TP will allow you to escape most gank situations, but only
				if you have the mana available for both.</li>
			<li>If you aren't partied up in a 5 stack, just use your ult defensively. <i>"Buuuut moooom, all the other
				heroes get to press R in a team fight." "Maybe when you're older, Slithice. Why can't you be like that
				nice boy Terrorblade and use your ult situationally?"</i></li>
			<li>You didn't listen to me, did you. You used it. See, Naga, this is why we can't trust you... Now look.
				Everyone is shuffling around awkwardly on your team because they're both seething with rage and because
				they can't tell if you want to commit to this failed fight or not. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Just press R
				again. Yeah that's right, you can cancel your ult. You can just act like it was a misclick.</li>
			<li>Supposing you <i>do</i> have a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some notable
				interactions with it. <b>Razor</b> - Song doesn't stop Static Link. <b>Undying</b> - Zombies continue
				to spawn on sleeping enemies. <b>Warlock</b> - Channel a fat Upheaval during the Song.<b>Weaver</b> - Swarm bugs
				can latch on sleeping units.</li>
			<li>If an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out,
				you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the spell immune enemy.</li>
			<li>Enemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't. This allows you to get
				uncontestable and rage inducing denies on towers.</li>
			<li>If you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin
				channeling your TP.</li>
			<li>There aren't many situations in which you want to use all 7 seconds of your ult. If you catch someone
				out with it, cancel it as soon as people are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more
				time to get over there.</li>
			<li>Roshan is deaf. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish
				Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.</li>
			<li>Comboing Song into Meteor Hammer is easier than you'd think. Don't bother timing it manually, just use shift
				queueing. Activate Song, cast Meteor Hammer, and shift+queue Song End while Hammer is channeling.</li>
			<li>If you need to get <i>really</i> tight with the timing, it gets slightly more complicated. 7.10 changed the
				linger time of Song so that enemies could perform instant actions before the Meteor Hammer lands on them. To
				counteract this, you'll need an active item that can be toggled like Ring of Basilius, Radiance, Power Treads, or even an
				Obs+Sentry Ward stack. Use the same combo as before, but add <b>three</b> shift+queued toggles of whatever active item before queueing the Song end.
				Song -> Meteor Hammer -> Shift+queue Basi or whatever three times -> Shift+queue Song End. Enemies will still be able to
				activate spell immunity, since that always takes tick priority, but you will <i>usually</i> be able to Meteor Hammer enemies before they
				can Blink Dagger or Force Staff. I say 'usually' because some factors like latency and what slot a player is in add some uncertainty to how
				reliable this mechanic is.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be wary of activating any sort of spell immunity before Naga uses Song, otherwise you might be setting
				yourself up to die before the team fight even starts.</li>
			<li>Because Naga spawns one "tick" before her illusions from a Mirror Image, you can attack+move before she Mirror Images
				and you'll always attack the real hero after she comes back.</li>
			<li>Ensnare is dispellable by items like Guardian Greaves, Eul's, Lotus Orb, or Manta Style.</li>
			<li>Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions.</li>
		</ul>
