		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Arcane Bolt gives vision as it travels. This is useful in mid matchups as you can use the brief vision
				before impact to get in one auto-attack if the enemy is on the high ground.</li>
			<li>The vision provided by Arcane Bolt on impact can also help land a Concussive Shot since Concussive can only
				fly to heroes if you have vision of them.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot has zero cast time. If you have the mana, always cast it if you're getting chased.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot will never select illusions to hit. If you're against a hero who uses a lot of
				illusions, save Concussive for when you want to find the real one.</li>
			<li>If there are no heroes in range, Concussive Shot will instead hit the nearest creep with reduced damage.</li>
			<li>Ancient Seal is the only single-targeted instant (zero cast time) silence in the game besides Orchid.
				The magic amplification is nice and all, but a guaranteed targeted silence is what makes this skill
				amazing. Cast+cancel this constantly on initiators before a team fight so you can instantly silence them
				when they try Blinking into your team.</li>
			<li>Enemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Ancient Seal). If they've already started channeling,
				however, a silence won't stop them.</li>
			<li>If you are free-balling a Mystic Flare, prediction and practice are your best bets to landing it
				consistently. You want the enemy to walk into the middle of the Flare half a second after you cast and
				then think to themselves, "Well, great, now it doesn't matter which direction I walk, I'm eating this
				ult."</li>
			<li>Mystic Flare damage works on Rosh.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>After picking up an Agh's Scepter, all your spells will search in a 700 radius around your primary target
				for additional targets that are not in fog.</li>
				<ul><li><span class="talent"></span>If you have the "Global Concussive Shot" talent, both Shots
				will search globally. The first Shot will hit the closest target like normal, but the second shot
				will pick another global target at random.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter multicasts also bypass things like Linken's Sphere or Lotus Orb. Since heroes are prioritized
				as secondary targets, you can fairly reliably cast Ancient Seal on solo heroes with Linken's by casting
				the silence on a nearby creep.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Mystic Flare attempts to place the secondary Mystic Flare on the center of a nearby hero. However,
				if there's already a Mystic Flare AoE on the center of a hero, it won't place a second one on top. So if you're trying to hit a single hero with double
				Mystic Flares, target your first Flare so that the edge of the AoE <i>does not cover</i> the middle of the enemy. If placed correctly,
				you should be able to hit a single hero with two Mystic Flares.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid trying to outrun Arcane Bolt unless you have some plan to not die to it. It's going to hit you
				regardless, all you're doing is giving the enemy team a tiny little ward that's giving away your
				location as you run.</li>
			<li>You can quickly move a Raindrop into your backpack to protect charges from weak Arcane Bolts.</li>
			<li>If Skywrath is spamming Arcane Bolt, get a Magic Stick. Just be aware that the Stick only gets charges
				if you have vision on the hero when they cast a spell.</li>
			<li>After Skywrath blows his mana load at level 1 with a thousand Arcane Bolts, he'll probably start sipping
				Clarities in the corner like a junkie. Don't let him.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot has a small AoE on impact. Avoid clumping up around the target that Concussive Shot is tailing.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot can only target you if Skywrath has vision of you. Try utilizing fog from trees when getting chased by Sky.
				If you get hit by a random Concussive in the late game, it's because Skywrath had vision of you and you may be under wards.</li>
			<li>Beware of the Mystic Flare combos on the enemy team. Nature's Prophet's Sprout or Clockwerk's Power Cogs
				may be annoying spells by themselves, but they become killboxes with a Skywrath. If this is a concern, get a Force Staff or Eul's.</li>
			<li>If Skywrath gets a Rod of Atos and is rooting you into Mystic Flare combos, remember that the Rod root can be dispelled by items like
				Manta Style, Satanic, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb.</li>
			<li>Oracle with Fate's Edict providing magic damage immunity can be annoying for Skywrath to deal with.</li>
			<li>Pugna can be a real pain for Skywrath because all of his spells cost a ton of mana and Nether Ward
				hurts.</li>
