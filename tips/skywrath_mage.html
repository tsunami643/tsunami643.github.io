		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Arcane Bolt gives vision as it travels. This is useful in mid matchups as you can use the brief vision
				before impact to get in one auto-attack if the enemy is on the high ground.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot has zero cast time. If you have the mana, always cast it if you're getting chased.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot will never select illusions to hit. If you're against a hero who uses a lot of
				illusions, save Concussive for when you want to find the real one.</li>
			<li>Ancient Seal is the only single-targeted instant (zero cast time) Silence in the game besides Orchid.
				The magic amplification is nice and all, but a guaranteed 6 second Silence is what makes this skill
				amazing. Cast+cancel this constantly on initiators before a team fight so you can instantly silence them
				when they try blinking into your team.</li>
			<li>If you are free-balling a Mystic Flare, prediction and practice are your best bets to landing it
				consistently. You want the enemy to walk into the middle of the Flare half a second after you cast and
				then think to themselves "Well, great, now it doesn't matter which direction I walk, I'm eating this
				ult."</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid trying to outrun Arcane Bolt unless you have some plan to not die to it. It's going to hit you
				regardless, all you're doing is giving the enemy team a tiny little ward that's giving away your
				location as you run.</li>
			<li>If Skywrath is spamming Arcane Bolt, get a Magic Stick. Just be aware that the Stick only gets charges
				if you have vision on the hero when they cast a spell.</li>
			<li>After Skywrath blows his mana load at level 1 with a thousand Arcane Bolts, he'll probably start sipping
				clarities in the corner like a junkie. Don't let him.</li>
			<li>Concussive Shot has a small AoE on impact. Like against Sven's Storm Hammer, avoid clumping up if a
				Concussive Shot is on your tail.</li>
			<li>Beware of the Mystic Flare combos on the enemy team. Sprout/Power Cogs may be annoying spells, but they
				become killboxes with a Skywrath. If this is a concern, get a Force Staff or Eul's.</li>
			<li>BKB completely shuts this hero down. Like, massively. Some INT heroes get pretty shut down with spell
				immunity, but Skywrath is on a whole 'nother level.</li>
			<li>Pugna can be a real pain for Skywrath because all of his spells cost a ton of mana and Nether Ward
				hurts.</li>
