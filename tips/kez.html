	</div>
	<div class="tips">
		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The majority of Kez's spells deal damage in the form of <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Attack_Damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attacks</a>.
				Instant attacks functionally behave like 'right click' attacks for most interactions, except they're dealt from abilities. There are a few unique notes:
				<ul>
					<li>Most instant attacks will apply attack modifiers (like crit/lifesteal/etc or roll for Maelstrom/Basher/etc). This is true for Kez's spells <i>except</i>
						Katana Stance Echo Slash does not proc cleave.</li>
					<li>Most instant attacks have true strike. This is <i>not</i> true for any of Kez's spells other than Sai Stance Talon Toss.</li>
					<li>Most instant attacks will still deal damage even if the hero is disarmed/ethereal. This is true for Kez's spells <i>except</i> Katana Stance
						Grappling Claw and Kazurai Katana.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr>
			<b style="color:#59bfec;">Sai Stance (Blue)</b> Tips:
				<li>Mechanically, Falcon Rush's sprint behaves similarly to Phantom Lancer's Phantom Rush. However, one difference is Falcon Rush
					<i>does not</i> work on buildings.</li>
				<li>If you see a unit across a cliff, but you're in Falcon Rush range, Kez will sprint to it taking the quickest pathing possible.</li>
				<li>You have increased slow resistance and phased movement when Falcon Rush is active.</li>
				<li>Falcon Rush works on enemy couriers and ward units.
					<ul><li>The Echo images fully count as additional melee hero attacks against ward units like Phoenix's Supernova or Shadow Shaman's
						Serpent Wards.</li></ul>				
				<li>You will generate Falcon Rush Echoes even if you miss your attack. However, the Echoes can also miss their attacks.</li>
				<li>In addition to right clicks, Falcon Rush Echoes can also be created from instant attacks, such as from Sai Stance Talon Toss
					or Katana Stance Grappling Claw.
					<ul><li><span class="scepter"></span>With Agh's Scepter, you can even create Falcon Rush Echoes from Sai Stance Echo Slash.</li></ul>
				<li>Falcon Rush Echoes can proc attack modifiers like crit and lifesteal.
					<ul><li>They can also proc random attack modifiers, like Maelstrom or Basher, but at a reduced chance.</li>
						<li>Echoes can create Shodo Sai Marks, but they can't trigger them.</li></ul>
				<li>You can only apply the Shodo Sai active parry mark and stun once to each enemy hero.
					<ul><li>Subsequent attacks can also be parried to avoid taking damage, but these parries will not reapply the mark or stun.</li>
						<li>You can parry tower or fountain attacks or attacks from enemy ward units. You won't hit these units back,
							but you won't take any damage from them.</li></ul>
				<li>You can Shodo Sai active parry <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Attack_Damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attacks</a>
					like Dawnbreaker's Starbreaker, Mars's God's Rebuke, or Monkey King's Boundless Strike.
					<ul><li>Shodo Sai active parry also works on 'split' instant attacks like Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon
						or Medusa's Split Shot.</li></ul>
				<li><span class="facet"></span><span class="scepter"></span>Once you have Agh's Scepter with the "Flutter" facet, you can swap from Katana stance
					to Sai stance, quickly cast and cancel Shodo Sai parry, then swap back to Katana and get the swap buffs at virtually no cost.</li>
				<li>Shodo Sai stuns can pierce debuff immunity/BKB.
					<ul><li>If you need a guaranteed stun on a debuff immune enemy, just cast Raven's Veil into Talon Toss. The Raven's Veil travel speed is faster
						than Talon Toss, so it'll apply the mark before Talon Toss's projectile connects.</li></ul>
				<li>Raven's Veil applies a basic dispel on your hero when cast.</li>
				<li>Raven's Veil gives a pretty large radius of lingering flying vision around your hero when cast.</li>
				<li>Unlike most sources of invisibility, Raven's Veil does <i>not</i> grant you phased movement.</li>
			<hr>
			<b style="color:#dd9c51;">Katana Stance (Orange)</b> Tips:
				<li>Each Echo Slash instance breaks trees in the AoE.</li>
				<li>Echo Slash can hit invisible units or units in fog.</li>
				<li>If you cast Echo Slash during the fade time of Shadow Blade/Silver Edge, you'll get the backstab damage on all targets in the AoE
					as long as you stay invisible.</li>
				<li>Echo Slash can damage enemies even if your hero is disarmed.</li>
				<li>You can cast Echo Slash while rooted/leashed, but you won't get the movement.</li>
				<li>Echo Slash's movement allows you to travel over cliffs.</li>
				<li>Orienting Echo Slashes to escape can sometimes be challenging when the game's pathing doesn't cooperate.
					A handy way to work around this is by enabling the "Holding ALT Enables Directional Move" option in settings.
					This command makes it so that whenever you're holding down ALT, your hero ignores pathing and tries to move in a straight line towards
					where you right clicked.
					<ul><li>You can also enable the "Directional Move" hotkey in the settings, but this ALT modifier may be easier to use
						once you get used to it.</li></ul>
				<li>You can use the slight delay on Echo Slash's movement to your advantage. It's tough, but you can
					cast Echo Slash right before getting teleported by an enemy Disruptor's Glimpse or Kunkka's X to return back to
					your Echo Slash cast point.</li>
					<ul><li>You can also dodge Disruptor Glimpse and Kunkka X with Grappling Claw. If the Claw hasn't connected to a tree/unit
						when Glimpse or X goes off, you'll get briefly returned and then immediately yanked back to the tree/unit.</li></ul>
				<li>Illusions can apply a weaker version of the Kazurai Katana debuff on enemies. You should always swap to Katana stance before activating an illusion rune
					because illusions don't benefit from any Sai Stance interactions.</li>
				<li>The Kazurai Katana active shares an invisible cooldown with your attack backswing. If you just attacked an enemy, you won't be able to
					cast Kazurai Katana until your backswing ends. So be be careful not to accidentally cancel the cast animation by mashing move commands.</li>
				<li>Raptor Dance applies a basic dispel on your hero when cast.</li>
				<li>At the beginning of Raptor Dance's cast, you're given an extremely brief period of invulnerability. This is similar to the beginning of
					Bane's Nightmare invulnerability in terms of mechanics and similar to a Manta Style dodge in terms of timing. You can use this
					invulnerability period to evade stuns or other incoming damage. Just be aware that once you start casting Raptor Dance, you're committed to
					the entire spell animation.</li>
				<li>You're immune to all sources of magic damage during the cast animation and active of Raptor Dance, but you're not debuff immune. Stuns and other
					disables can still affect you.
					<ul><li>However, once you start slashing, nothing can cancel your Raptor Dance damage from going out.</li></ul>
				<li>Despite its appearance, Raptor Dance is <i>not</i> an instant attack. It's just multiple pure damage nukes. This means it doesn't really
					synergize with any of your other spells for damage.
					<ul><li>This also means that Raptor Dance <i>does not</i> proc any attack modifiers. So don't bother activating Satanic for lifesteal before Raptor
						Dancing, it won't do anything.</li>
						<li>However, despite being a pure damage nuke, for some reason you cannot deal Raptor Dance damage to ethereal units. Idk lol.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ghost Scepter completely owns this guy. He's all physical damage and can't touch you if you're ethereal.
				<ul><li>Ghost Scepter even protects you from his Raptor Dance even though it's technically a pure damage nuke.</li></ul>
			<li>Faceless Void's Time Dilation is twice as effective on Kez since two of his spells are going on cooldown.</li>
			<li>Kez's Falcon Rush echoed attacks give vision over your hero which makes him difficult to juke in fog.</li>
			<li>Kez's Talon Toss dagger projectile can be disjointed with invisibility or blinks.</li>
			<li>Kez can't cast Grappling Hook if he's rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>You can dispel Kazurai Katana stacks.</li>
			<li>You can't turn your hero when you're stabbed by his Kazurai Katana active. So if you're trying to cast a directionally targeted spell,
				like an Anti-Mage Blink, target it directly in front of your hero otherwise you'll be stuck.</li>
			<li>Kez is probably facing your team when he's Shodo Sai parrying. Why not give him a playful little push into your team with a Force Staff.</li>
			<li>Kez is immune to magic damage during Raptor Dance's cast animation and active slashes.</li>
				<ul><li>He's not <i>debuff</i> immune, though. Just immune to magic <i>damage</i>. You can interrupt Kez's Raptor Dance cast animation with stuns or silences</li>
					<li>Once the Raptor Dance slashes start, however, they can't be stopped.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Blade Mail completely owns this guy. Half the time he doesn't even know how he's dealing damage to you, it just keeps happening.</li>
			<li>Silences and mana burns completely own this guy. Kez players put themselves into incredibly dangerous situations because they assume they'll
				be able to escape using his 30 different abilities that all have blinks and dispels. That only works
				when he's able to cast them.</li>
