		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Swashbuckle sets your damage flat and attacks every unit in the AoE multiple times. There are a few interactions to note:
				<ul>
				<li>Even though there are several... swashes? Each target receives their own individual 'attack' per swash strike. A Javelin Piercing one
					target doesn't mean every target will get Pierced on the same strike.
				</li>
				<li>Each attack will burn mana with Diffusal Blade.
				</li>
				<li>Crits are not great because they multiply off of Swashbuckle's damage, not your attack damage.
				</li>
				<li>Basher gives you a pretty high probability of Bashing a target in Swashbuckle, but only one unit in the AoE can
					ever get bashed due to Basher's cooldown.
				</li>
				<li>Maelstrom also has a cooldown, but you can potentially proc it twice in a Swashbuckle.
				</li>
				<li>Quelling Blade doesn't add damage to creeps in Swashbuckle.
				</li>
				<li>Cleave can take advantage of the individual Swashbuckle attacks since each target will proc its own cleave AoE.
				</li>
				<li>If you slide through a target while traveling in Swashbuckle, you have an instance of Swashbuckle damage around your hero.
					<a href="https://streamable.com/yo8fu">The collision size for this damage instance is tiny, but it gives you
						another chance to proc a Lucky Shot or item effect.</a>
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Swashbuckle attacks have true strike and works through disarms.
			</li>
			<li>Since Swashbuckle counts as an <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Attack_Damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attack</a>, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.</li>
			<li>Swashbuckle and Shield Crash's movements are classed as forced movement. You can use them to move up and down cliffs,
				travel through trees without destroying them, and break out of spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field.
			</li>
			<li>You don't <i>always</i> have to Swashbuckle backwards, you know? Sometimes if you're escaping and there's no chance of landing
				a Swashbuckle hit on a pursuing enemy, you may just be giving away your position by Swashbuckling into their vision.</li>
			<li>Every time you successfully hit a hero in Shield Crash, the barrier amount increments and the buff is refreshed.</li>
			<li>Your Shield Crash barrier incrementing is a good way to verify if enemies are hiding nearby in fog or invisible.</li>
			<li>Shield Crash's barrier buff doesn't factor illusions as valid heroes, but it does factor clones. Like Meepo. Sweet, sweet Meepo.</li>
			<li>Because barriers prevent your actual HP from being touched, you can use regen like Bottle without it getting broken as long as the barrier
				is taking the damage. This also prevents your Blink Dagger from getting broken when taking enemy damage.</li>
			<li>You're disabled during the Shield Crash animation when walking, but you're not disabled during the Shield Crash animation
				when Rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dZPynEI5Sw?t=20">This means
					that you can cancel a Rolling Shield Crash into Swashbuckle to move your Shield Crash landing AoE.</a>
			</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Each Agh's Scepter Swashbuckle AoE from Shield Crash slightly overlaps in the corners around your hero.
				<a href="https://youtu.be/7dZPynEI5Sw?t=64">You can potentially deal more damage to a target if you Shield Crash next to them diagonally.</a></li>
			<li>If you shift+queue Blink Dagger+Shield Crash during your Rolling Thunder cast animation, you'll blink to the
				location and Shield Crash vertically in place. However, your Rolling Thunder will not damage or stun enemies until <i>after</i> the
				Shield Crash cast finishes landing.
			</li>
			<li>If you cancel Rolling Thunder in the middle of jumping in Shield Crash, you'll immediately drop down and Shield Crash in place
				without keeping the Rolling Thunder momentum.</li>
			<li>You can jump off the edges of the map in Rolling Thunder with Shield Crash. I can really only see this being useful if you want to hide
				yourself as you TP out if you think the enemy can cancel it.
			</li>
			<li>Shield Crash has a shorter cooldown if cast while in Rolling Thunder.
				<ul><li>You can even go <i>into</i> Rolling Thunder while Shield Crash is already on cooldown and it'll
					immediately be reduced.</li>
				<li><span class="shard"></span>The prior notes also apply to Agh's Shard Roll Up form.</li></ul>
			<li>When playing against Rubick, immediately Shield Crash after going into Rolling Thunder. Putting Shield Crash on cooldown is usually worth
				preventing Rubick from Spell Stealing your ult.
			</li>
			<li>All items work while in Rolling Thunder:
				<ul>
				<li>You can channel a TP while Rolling.
				</li>
				<li>You can Blink while Rolling. You'll continue Rolling in the same direction after Blinking.
				</li>
				<li>You can Eul's yourself while Rolling to multihit a single enemy without needing to bounce.
				</li>
				<li>If you don't press anything except for the Shield Crash hotkey while in the Eul's cyclone, you'll do stationary Shield Crash in-place after landing.
				</li>
				<li>You can Harpoon an enemy while Rolling to drag yourself towards them for a stun.
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Rolling Thunder can bounce into Lotus Pools, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Earthshaker's Fissure, Tusk's Ice Shards,
				and Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier. You don't bounce off any other structures, like towers, though.
				<ul><li>The secret shop owners can also be bounced into. The Radiant secret shop owner has a pretty janky hitbox, though.</li></ul>
			<li>It's impossible to consecutively chain stun an enemy with Rolling Thunder. Even with perfect bounces, they can always get a BKB or instant
				cast spell off between bumps.</li>
			<li>You can drive by an Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher and channel it in the middle of Rolling Thunder. Just make sure you're fine with traveling in a straight line
				for a few seconds because changing your direction will cancel the channel.</li>
			<li>You can mess with Rolling Thunder's trajectory by repeatedly attempting to enter a Twin Gate or an Underlord's Fiend's Gate.</li>
			<li>Rolling Thunder provides debuff immunity and also serves as a basic dispel on cast.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Roll Up provides debuff immunity but does <i>not</i> apply a dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Normally, roots/leashes prevent you from using your movement spells. However, you can cast Agh's Shard Roll Up through roots/leashes.
				If the disable does not pierce debuff immunity, then you should be able to Rolling Thunder or Swashbuckle while in Roll Up.</li>
			<li>Hitting someone in Chronosphere with Rolling Thunder will damage and bump them away like normal and you'll continue Rolling
				in place on the edge of the Chrono.</li>
			<li>The moment you ricochet off a wall, there's an extremely small window of time when you can click in the same direction
				you were traveling to keep bumping into the same wall.</a> It requires nearly tick perfect timing, but there's no harm in going for it.
				<ul><li>If you're committed to using this trick, there is a method to consistently pull this off and perma-bounce against a wall.
					If you have a mouse with a freescrolling wheel, type in your console:
					<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">bind mwheeldown mc_move</font><br><br>
					And enable the "Quick Move" option in the settings menu. This will bind the move command to your mousewheel down and makes your hero
					act whenever a move hotkey is pressed. Now you can spin mousewheel down to issue a million move commands at once which
					solves the whole 'timing' issue with this trick.</li>
					<li><i>"But Tsunami, the 'Auto-repeat Right Mouse' setting already exists!"</i> Yup and even that doesn't click fast enough to
						pull this tech off.</li>
					</ul>
			<li>Pangolier is the only hero in the game that doesn't have to turn to cast items.
			</li>
			<li>Lucky Shot's debuff works on Rosh.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pangolier can't cast Swashbuckle or Rolling Thunder if he's rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>The Shield Crash barrier can be dispelled off Pango.</li>
			<li>Leashes/roots that go through debuff immunity (like Grimstroke's Soulbind) will cause Pango's
				Rolling Thunder do a burnout and just spin in place.</li>
			<li>Stuns that go through debuff immunity won't cancel Rolling Thunder, but Pango will stop moving during the stun.
			<ul><li>The only exception is Primal Beast's Pulverize. For some reason Pulverize instantly cancels Rolling Thunder.</li></ul>
			<li>Bloodseeker's Rupture forces Pangolier to make some tough choices about life while Rolling.</li>
			<li>Pango is only <i>debuff</i> immune in Rolling Thunder. He can still be attacked and take damage. Difficult if you're a melee
				hero, but ranged heroes can still hit him easily.</li>
			<li>If you're touching a high/low ground cliff, Pango may push you to the other level of terrain with the Rolling Thunder bump.
				Try hugging a cliff if he's about to run you over to possibly escape the pinball machine.</li>
			<li>The occasional question marks you see pop up above Pango sometimes when attacking him are his Fortune Favors the Bold innate procs.</li>
