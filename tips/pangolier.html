		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Swashbuckle sets your damage flat and attacks every unit in the AoE four times. There are a few interactions to note:
			</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Even though there are four... swashes? Each target receives their own individual 'attack.' A Javelin Piercing one
					target doesn't mean every target will get Pierced on the same swipe.
				</li>
				<li>Javelin is a popular damage option regardless.
				</li>
				<li>Each attack will burn mana with Diffusal Blade.
				</li>
				<li>Crits are not great because they multiply off of Swashbuckle's damage, but Bloodthorn can be good since the active
					will guarantee a crit for all four attacks.
				</li>
				<li>Basher gives you a pretty high probability Bashing a target in Swashbuckle, but only one unit in the AoE can
					ever get bashed due to Basher's cooldown.
				</li>
				<li>Maelstrom also has a cooldown, but you can potentially proc it twice in a Swashbuckle.
				</li>
				<li>Echo Sabre will slow every target in the AoE and won't put the Sabre on cooldown.
				</li>
				<li>Quelling Blade doesn't add damage to creeps in Swashbuckle.
				</li>
				<li>Cleave can take advantage of the individual Swashbuckle attacks since each target will proc its own cleave AoE.
				</li>
				<li>If you slide through a target while traveling in Swashbuckle, you have an instance of Swashbuckle damage around your hero.
					<a href="https://streamable.com/yo8fu">The collision size for this damage instance is tiny, but it gives you
						another chance to proc a Lucky Shot or item effect.</a>
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Swashbuckle attacks have true strike and works through disarms.
			</li>
			<li>Since Swashbuckle uses Pango's 'right click,' it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.</li>
			<li>Swashbuckle and Shield Crash's movements are classed as forced movement. You can use them to move up and down cliffs,
				travel through trees without destroying them, and break out of spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field.
			</li>
			<li>Every time you successfully hit a hero in Shield Crash, the damage resistance buff is refreshed. The resistance buff
				can increase if you hit more heroes, but it'll never decrease if you hit fewer heroes.
			</li>
			<li>Shield Crash doesn't factor illusions for damage reduction, but it does factor clones. Like Meepo. Sweet, sweet Meepo.
			</li>
			<li>You're disabled during the Shield Crash animation when walking, but you're not disabled during the Shield Crash animation
				when Rolling. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7d2rog/pangolier_trick_that_people_may_not_know/">This means
					that you can cancel a Rolling Shield Crash into Swashbuckle to move your Shield Crash landing AoE.</a>
			</li>
			<li>If you shift+queue Blink Dagger+Shield Crash during your Rolling Thunder cast animation, you'll blink to the
				location and Shield Crash vertically in place. However, your Rolling Thunder will not damage or stun enemies until <i>after</i> the
				Shield Crash cast finishes landing.
			</li>
			<li>You can jump off the edges of the map in Rolling Thunder with Shield Crash. I can really only see this being useful if you want to hide
				yourself as you TP out if you think the enemy can cancel it.
			</li>
			<li>When playing against Rubick, immediately Shield Crash after going into Rolling Thunder. Putting Shield Crash on cooldown is usually worth
				preventing Rubick from Spell Stealing your ult.
			</li>
			<li>All items work while in Rolling Thunder:
			</li>
				<ul>
				<li>You can channel a TP while Rolling.
				</li>
				<li>You can Blink while Rolling. You'll continue Rolling in the same direction after Blinking.
				</li>
				<li>You can Eul's yourself while Rolling to multihit a single enemy without needing to bounce.
				</li>
				<li>If you don't press anything except for the Shield Crash hotkey while in the Eul's Cyclone, you'll do stationary Shield Crash in-place after landing.
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Rolling Thunder can bounce into the secret shops, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Earthshaker's Fissure, and Tusk's Ice Shards.
				You don't bounce off any other structures, though.</li>
			<li>Rolling Thunder provides spell immunity and also serves as a basic dispel on cast.
			</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Roll Up provides spell immunity and also serves as a basic dispel on cast.
			</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can cast Agh's Shard Roll Up through roots/leashes. If the leash does not pierce spell immunity,
				then you should be able to Rolling Thunder or Swashbuckle out right after.</li>
			<li>Hitting someone in Chronosphere with Rolling Thunder will damage and bump them away like normal and you'll continue Rolling
				in place on the edge of the Chrono.</li>
			<li>The moment you ricochet off a wall, there's an extremely small window of time when you can click in the same direction
				you were traveling to keep <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/aiyec7/a_pangolier_trick_that_i_am_positive_noone_knows/">bumping
				into the same wall.</a> It requires nearly tick perfect timing, but there's no harm in going for it.
			</li>
			<li>Pangolier is the only hero in the game that doesn't have to turn to cast items.
			</li>
			<li>Lucky Shot's disarm works on Rosh.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pangolier can't cast Swashbuckle or Rolling Thunder if he's rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>The Shield Crash damage reduction buff can be purged off Pango.</li>
			<li>Leashes/roots that go through spell immunity (like Puck's Agh's Scepter Dream Coil or Grimstroke's Soulbind) will cause Pango's
				Rolling Thunder do a burnout and just spin in place.</li>
			<li>Stuns that go through spell immunity won't cancel Rolling Thunder, but Pango will stop moving during the stun.</li>
			<li>Bloodseeker's Rupture forces Pangolier to make some tough choices about life while Rolling.</li>
			<li>Pango is only <i>spell</i> immune in Rolling Thunder. He can still be attacked and take damage. Difficult if you're a melee
				hero, but ranged heroes can still hit him easily.</li>
		</ul>
