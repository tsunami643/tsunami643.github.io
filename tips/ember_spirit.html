		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The capture radius on Searing Chains is fairly large, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll
				probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can
				position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than <s>complaining about</s> relying on RNG.</li>
			<li>While Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a
				disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage
				or stun.</li>
			<li>You can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends
				before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight Remnant.</li>
			<li>You can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants
				during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when
				chasing enemies. Activating them at the tail end of a Sleight will also make you extremely difficult to lock down
				when being chased.</li>
			<li>The hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chain combo on solo targets is knowing when Sleight will actually go off.
				Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to
				Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to Sleight+Chain someone who's in a clump of other units, you should save the Chains until later
				in the Sleight. It's possible you may kill off some other useless units while Sleighting which improves
				your chances of Chaining the hero.</li>
			<li>I highly recommend enabling the "Show Ability Rangefinder While Casting" interface option in the game settings.
				For Ember, it becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off when you can see the cast range.</li>
			<li>When manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the
				fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of
				your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto
				attacks.</li>
			<li>Unlike most other spells involving <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">'instant attacks,'</a>
				using Sleight <i>won't</i> break your Smoke when used on creeps.</li>
			<li>You can Sleight of Fist a Bane Nightmare'd unit and they won't wake up.</li>
			<li>Sleight of Fist lands on units in fog. Use this to scout high ground or treelines, stack jungle camps, or check
				the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Sleight of Fist will deal no damage if you're disarmed.</li>
			<li>Neutral items won't drop from creeps if you're in Sleight of Fist or traveling in Fire Remnants.
				So if you haven't gotten all your neutral items yet, avoid last hitting with those spells, otherwise
				the creeps will have a zero percent chance of dropping a neutral item.</li>
			<li>Raindrops absorb damage before Flame Guard does. If you're trying to preserve your Flame Guard in lane for damage
				or to help last hit, a Raindrop may buy you some more damage to tank.</li>
			<li>Your Remnants travel at 2.5x your move speed when cast. This means that you should avoid casting fresh
				Remnants if you're trying to escape when you're slowed.</li>
			<li>This also applies to weird spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Slark's Pounce. If you walk
				to the very edge of these spells then your move speed is considered zero and your Remnant won't go
				anywhere.</li>
			<li>You can pick up items, such as Aegis or runes, while traveling to a Remnant or when flying around in a Sleight of Fist.</li>
			<li>When traveling to a Fire Remnant, you deal damage to everything on the way in a 225 radius around your hero.</li>
			<li>Use Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so
				you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map
				as soon as you respawn (or buyback).</li>
			<li>You consume all Remnants when activating to one. Ember travels to the Fire Remnant furthest away from the
				targeted one first.</li>
			<li>After you gank a lane, consider hiding a Remnant somewhere nearby for safekeeping before you return to a
				different part of the map. Another gank opportunity may present itself in the same lane and enemies may not expect it.</li>
			<li>When contesting runes, consider sending a Remnant to one rune spot and walking your hero to the other rune spot.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Damage from multiple Agh's Shard Remnants do not stack.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>With Agh's Shard, you'll spawn a Remnant wherever you die.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Whenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll
				always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up disables like Dark Willow's Bramble Maze,
				Jakiro's Ice Path, Mirana's Arrow, or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can
				catch him as soon as he returns.</li>
			<li>Ember hates silences, but he also really hates slows. The travel speed on Remnant casts scale off of
				Ember's own move speed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll
				need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.</li>
			<li>Ember cannot Activate Fire Remnant or cast Sleight of Fist when rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Ember consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he Activates one.</li>
			<li>Sleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.</li>
			<li>You can purge off Flame Guard. This makes Eul's and Nullifier solid items to have against Ember.</li>
			<li>Ember can pick up runes while flying around in a Sleight of Fist. Depending on how good of an Ember player
				you're against, you should consider stopping for a moment just short of a rune to bait his Sleight so
				that he can't snatch it from you.</li>
