		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The capture radius on Searing Chains is fairly large, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll
				probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can
				position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than <s>complaining about</s> relying on RNG.</li>
			<li>While Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a
				disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage
				or stun.</li>
			<li>Casting Sleight of Fist during Shadow Blade's fade time will deal the bonus Backstab damage to all targets
				in the AoE.</li>
			<li>You can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends
				before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight Remnant.</li>
			<li>You can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants
				during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when
				chasing enemies. Activating them at the tail end of a Sleight will also make you extremely difficult to lock down
				when being chased.</li>
			<li>The hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chain combo on solo targets is knowing when Sleight will actually go off.
				Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to
				Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to Sleight+Chain someone who's in a clump of other units, you should save the Chains until later
				in the Sleight. It's possible you may kill off some other useless units while Sleighting which improves
				your chances of Chaining the hero.</li>
			<li>I highly recommend enabling the "Show Ability Rangefinder While Casting" interface option in the game settings.
				For Ember, it becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off when you can see the cast range.</li>
			<li>When manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the
				fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of
				your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto
				attacks.</li>
			<li>Your Remnants travel at 2.5x your move speed when cast. This means that you should avoid casting fresh
				Remnants if you're trying to escape when you're slowed.</li>
			<li>This also applies to weird spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Slark's Pounce. If you walk
				to the very edge of these spells then your move speed is considered zero and your Remnant won't go
				anywhere.</li>
			<li>A way to get around slow Remnants is to put out a Remnant while in Sleight of Fist. A Remnant sent out
				during a Sleight will travel at normal speeds.</li>
			<li>You can pick up items, such as Aegis or runes, while traveling to a Remnant or when flying around in a Sleight of Fist.</li>
			<li>When traveling to a Fire Remnant, you deal damage to everything on the way in a 225 radius around your hero.</li>
			<li>Use Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so
				you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map
				as soon as you respawn (or buyback).</li>
			<li>TP scrolls do not share a cooldown with Boots of Travel, so always keep a scroll available in your inventory
				in case of emergency.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Whenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll
				always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up stuns like Mirana's Arrow or
				Jakiro's Ice Path or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can
				catch him as soon as he returns.</li>
			<li>Ember hates silences, but he also really hates slows. The travel speed on Remnant casts scale off of
				Ember's own move speed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll
				need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.</li>
			<li>Ember cannot Activate Fire Remnant when rooted.</li>
			<li>You can click on Ember and look at his buffs to see if he has a Remnant out, and if so, how much time is
				left on it (by viewing the buff timer). You can also see how many Remnant charges he has available.</li>
			<li>Ember consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he Activates one.</li>
			<li>Sleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.</li>
			<li>You can purge off Flame Guard. This makes Eul's and Nullifier solid items to have against Ember.</li>
