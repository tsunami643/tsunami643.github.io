		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Every attribute is harder, better, faster, and stronger in melee form. Typically the only reasons you
				should be in ranged form after the laning phase is to cast the ranged Whirling Axes, get hits on an enemy
				if you're blocked out by something like Earthshaker's Fissure or Clockwerk's Cogs,
				or to get one very last hit on an enemy before they escape. If you're trying to stay safe during a push,
				it can also be worthwhile to siege in ranged form.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Berserker's Rage forms while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>If you're toggled into melee Berserker's Rage when your ranged attack projectile connects, it will land as a 'melee' attack.
				Toggled attacks can't root, but they can cleave in front of your hero, apply the melee version of attack modifiers,
				and they will never miss uphill, which can be relevant in the mid lane.</li>
			<li>Troll is the dumbest hero in the game with just +1 INT growth per level. Whirling Axes (Melee) is a great wave
				clearing spell, but Troll runs out of magic juice fast. Keep eyes on your mana pool.</li>
			<li>Neither the blind, nor the damage, from Whirling Axes (Melee) work on Rosh.</li>
			<li>Casting Battle Trance applies a basic dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li>Mechanically, activating Battle Trance is like having a Dazzle Shallow Grave cast on Troll. So whatever interactions work against
				Shallow Grave (like dying through Axe's Culling Blade, but not instantly shattering to Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast) are true with Battle Trance as well.</li>
			<li>When locked on to a target, you can't choose your movement or cast items, but you can toggle Berserker's Rage
				forms and cast both Whirling Axes.</li>
			<li>You can force yourself to stay permanently locked on a target by casting Battle Trance while you're in the middle
				of your attack animation. For example, if you want to stay attacking a tower and don't want an enemy walking by to
				pull your Battle Trance aggro, cast Battle Trance while you're mid-attack animation on the tower. You'll stick to the
				tower until it dies. This also works on Roshan or ward-type units.</li>
			<li>You'll chase a target until it dies once you're locked on in Battle Trance. However, if your target is outside your
				ranged form attack range, you can reacquire the nearest available target by toggling into melee form.</li>
			<li>If a target is about to fog you, consider activating Battle Trance just to keep them in vision. You maintain shared vision
				through fog of war when they're the focus of your Trance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Troll's no Ursa, but he can still solo Rosh fairly early in the game.</li>
			<li>The blind on Whirling Axes (Melee) is obnoxious and usually worth getting a King Bar for. It also means
				that you need to be very careful when ganking him if you rely heavily on right clicks for damage.</li>
			<li>Troll's entire kit revolves around making chop suey out of a single target. If he has to switch focus
				before killing a target, you're doing a good job dealing with him. Force Staffs, Ghost Scepter, Eulses, and Banishes
				are all ideal counters.</li>
			<li>Troll gets shared vision on a locked target during Battle Trance if they're within the acquisition range, so you
				can't fog him to lose aggro.</li>
			<li>Troll ignores taunts when in Battle Trance, however fears can prevent him from attacking.</li>
			<li>Axe can Culling Blade instagib Troll even when he's in Battle Trance.</li>
