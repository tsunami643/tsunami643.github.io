		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Eul's Cyclone can practically guarantee a Cold Feet stun on a target.</li>
			<li>Ice Vortex is more than a massive range slow. It's also a ground targeted Veil of Discord that lowers magic
				resistance. Throw them all over the place when you're pushing or defending to make enemies more vulnerable
				to magic damage. Keep this in mind when attacking people with Chilling Touch's magical
				damage as well.</li>
			<li>Ice Vortex is also a great scouting tool with the vision it provides. Use it to scout out Rosh attempts
				or to check high ground or to help with counterwarding.</li>
			<li>Ice Blast is a great way to disable enemy Blink Daggers for an extended period of time. You don't even need
				to land the Blast, as long as they get the Frostbite DoT debuff, an enemy's Dagger will stay broken for the whole
				duration.</li>
			<li>Shoot your ult further than you think it should go in most short range encounters. The Shatter debuff
				can be more useful than the nuke in some situations and as long as an enemy is along the path of the
				projectile, they'll get frosted. Plus, the Ice Blast projectile travels slow as hell at low ranges and
				it's very easy for people to outrun it the second they see it.</li>
			<li>If the enemy team came out on top after a fight, consider shooting an Ice Blast to the nearest shrine.
				You may catch some low HP stragglers trying to get some emergency regen.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can see the Tracer for AA's ult on your minimap if you have true sight (which is how you can see it
				flying over your ancient when he's shooting it at your fountain). If you're taking Rosh, put a sentry ward
				outside the pit and have someone stand outside and keep eyes on the minimap to see if you're getting Ice
				Blasted.</li>
			<li>If you're walking back to the fountain at low HP and an enemy AA is alive, take a short break and try to
				bait the Ice Blast. It's worth spending a few extra seconds standing somewhere else in your base rather than risking
				getting Blasted in your fountain.</li>
			<li>If you're too impatient to wait, you can go into your fountain and buy a cheeky Raindrop. If the Blast lands,
				it may save you, if it doesn't, sell it back.</li>
			<li>His ult is famous for having Dota 2's most complicated tooltip. If you're against an AA, all you need to
				know is that if his ult flew over your head, you have a debuff that won't let you heal any HP. No
				lifesteal, no fountain regen, no Tranquil Boots, no Urn of Shadows, no PYOORIFICAYSHUN. Just you sitting
				and praying that you don't drop below the Shattering threshold.</li>
			<li>The exceptions to the no-HP regen under Ice Blast rule are: Sunder, Decay, Time Lapse, and toggling out of a Morph.</li>
