		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ursa can Earthshock to jump up or down cliffs and out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Mars's Arena of Blood.</li>
			<li>You consume Overpower stacks on denial attacks.</li>
			<li>The duration on the Overpower buff is longer than the  spell's cooldown. Meaning that before you go in for a
				gank or into Rosh, you should cast Overpower well in advance so a second cast is already in the
				chamber when you need it.</li>
			<li>When laning, try to keep Fury Swipe stacks up like you would Batrider's Sticky Napalm, especially
				against melee heroes. Ursa has very high base armor, so it can be worth tanking creep aggro to build more Fury Swipe stacks.</li>
			<li>Casting Enrage applies a <a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">basic dispel</a>
				on your hero. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or roots.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you get an Agh's Scepter, Enrage becomes a strong dispel allowing you to purge off stuns as well.</li>
			<li>TAKE THE ROSH TIMERÂ WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GRIZZLY-ASS, POLAR-ASS, BROWN-ASS, BLACK-ASS,
				APPARENTLY-GIANT-PANDAS-ARE-ALSO-A-MEMBER-OF-THE-BEAR-FAMILY-ASS HERO.
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">bind "b" "chatwheel_say 57" //Current Time</font><br><br>
				Paste that in your <font face="courier new"><i>dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\autoexec.cfg</i></font> (create the file if it's not already there)
				and you can note the time whenever you press B. Ballers, you're putting numbers on the boards.</li>
			<li>If you're too lazy to do that, then alt+click on the clock or enable 'Current Time' in your chat
				wheel. If your team has a habit of pinging the clock for bounty runes and you think
				you'll lose the Rosh time, just type the time in the chat and press Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C to preserve it in your clipboard.</li>
			<li>I legit can't stress enough how important it is to keep track of Rosh as an Ursa, so as a third tip you can also add:
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">dota_hud_chat_history_lines 40 //More Chat Lines</font><br><br>
				Into your <font face="courier new"><i>autoexec.cfg</i></font> to allow the chat history to scroll up further. Just be
				aware that increasing the number too much will make your game lag every time you open chat.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ursa has no stuns, so keep your finger on the TP when you see him moseying on down towards you.</li>
			<li>Ursa gets bonus status resistance while in Enrage. So if possible, try to save your disables for when Enrage ends, rather
				than during the buff.</li>
			<li>You really need at least one Force Staff on your team against Ursa, preferably more. After that, Eul's,
				Scythe of Vyse, Aeon Disk, and Ghost Scepter are all good support items against Ursa.</li>
			<li>Eul's Cyclone duration doesn't get reduced by status resistance.</li>
			<li>Heaven's Halberd and Ethereal Blade can briefly prevent Ursa from slicing up your team.</li>
			<li>Keep eyes in and on the Rosh pit when you know it's up. If you have a spell that can give you lasting
				vision inside the pit (like Techies Remote Mines or Templar Assassin Traps), get one in before his first Rosh.</li>
			<li>Ursa can purge himself with Enrage, heroes with unpurgeable abilities like Invoker's Deafening Blast,
				Viper's Viper Strike, or Bloodseeker's Rupture are quite useful. Enrage also can't
				purge off the Heaven's Halberd disarm.</li>
			<li>You can purge Overpower stacks off of Ursa, making heroes like Shadow Demon or Oracle fairly
				good.</li>
			<li>Shadow Demon is especially good since Enrage can't dispel Demonic Purge. So not only are you slowing Ursa to a crawl,
				but Overpower will get insta-dispelled if he casts it.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Ursa's Agh's Scepter allows him to Enrage out of stuns (similar to Abaddon's Borrowed Time),
				but he still won't be able to ult when hexed or silenced.</li>
