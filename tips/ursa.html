	<div class="tips">
		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ursa can Earthshock to jump up or down cliffs and out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field.</li>
			<li>You consume Overpower stacks on denial attacks.</li>
			<li>The duration on the Overpower buff is longer than the  spell's cooldown. Meaning that before you go in for a
				gank or into Rosh, you should cast Overpower well in advance so a second cast is already in the
				chamber when you need it.</li>
			<li>When laning, try to keep Fury Swipe stacks up like you would Batrider's Sticky Napalm, especially
				against melee heroes. Ursa has very high base armor, so it can be worth tanking creep aggro to build more Fury Swipe stacks.</li>
			<li>Casting Enrage applies a <a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">dispel</a>
				on your hero. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or roots.
			<ul><li><span class="scepter"></span>If you get an Agh's Scepter, Enrage becomes a strong dispel allowing you to purge off stuns as well.</li>
				<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Overpower does <i>not</i> apply the Enrage dispel.</li></ul>
			<li>TAKE THE ROSH TIMER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GRIZZLY-ASS, POLAR-ASS, BROWN-ASS, BLACK-ASS,
				APPARENTLY-GIANT-PANDAS-ARE-ALSO-A-MEMBER-OF-THE-BEAR-FAMILY-ASS HERO.
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">bind "b" "chatwheel_say 57" //Current Time</font><br><br>
				Paste that in your <font face="courier new"><i>dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\autoexec.cfg</i></font> (create the file if it's not already there)
				and you can note the time whenever you press B. Ballers, you're putting numbers on the boards.</li>
			<li>If you're too lazy to do that, then alt+click on the clock or enable 'Current Time' in your chat
				wheel. If your team has a habit of pinging the clock for bounty runes and you think
				you'll lose the Rosh time, just type the time in the chat and press Ctrl+A and Ctrl+X/Ctrl+C to preserve it in your clipboard.</li>
			<li>I legit can't stress enough how important it is to keep track of Rosh as an Ursa, so as a third tip you can also add:
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">dota_hud_chat_history_lines 40 //More Chat Lines</font><br><br>
				Into your <font face="courier new"><i>autoexec.cfg</i></font> to allow the chat history to scroll up further. Just be
				aware that increasing the number too much will make your game lag every time you open chat.</li>
			<li>There's a secret item in the game called <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Cheese">Block of Cheese.</a> You make it by combining
				18 Healing Lotuses and 1 Cheese. Will this ever happen in a game? No. But it's cool to think about.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ursa has no stuns, so keep your finger on your TP when you see him bearing down on you.</li>
			<li>Ursa gets bonus status resistance while in Enrage. So if possible, try to save your disables for when Enrage ends, rather
				than during the buff.
			<ul><li>The red Enrage visual on Ursa is pretty deceptive. He actually grows when Enrage is active and starts shrinking back
				once it wears off. The red visual fades out ~1.5 seconds <i>after</i> the Enrage buff ends.</li></ul>
			<li>You really need at least one Force Staff on your team against Ursa, preferably more. After that, Eul's,
				Scythe of Vyse, Aeon Disk, and Ghost Scepter are all good support items against Ursa.</li>
			<li>Eul's Cyclone duration doesn't get reduced by status resistance which makes it a good counter against Enrage.</li>
			<li>Heaven's Halberd and Ethereal Blade can briefly prevent Ursa from slicing up your team.</li>
			<li>Ursa can purge himself with Enrage, heroes with unpurgeable abilities like Invoker's Deafening Blast,
				Viper's Viper Strike, or Bloodseeker's Rupture are quite useful. Enrage also can't
				purge off the Heaven's Halberd disarm.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Ursa's Agh's Scepter allows him to Enrage out of stuns (similar to Abaddon's Borrowed Time),
				but he still won't be able to ult when hexed or silenced.</li>
			<li>You can purge Overpower stacks off of Ursa, making heroes like Enchantress (Enchant), Oracle (Fortune's End),
				and Shadow Demon (Demonic Purge) fairly good.
			<ul><li>Shadow Demon is especially useful since Enrage can't dispel Demonic Purge. So not only are you slowing Ursa to a crawl,
				but Overpower will get insta-dispelled if he casts it. Just try to cast Demonic Purge on Ursa <i>before</i> Enrage is active,
				otherwise Enrage's status resistance will reduce the duration of the debuff.</li></ul>
			<li>Breaking Ursa only stops him from adding new Fury Swipe stacks, it does not stop him from getting bonus damage from
				existing stacks.</li>
			<li>Ursa likes to sneak his first Rosh very early on in the game. It can be worth the effort to plant wards
				around the pit early on if he's lazy and doesn't smoke into Rosh.</li>
