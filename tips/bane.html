		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enfeeble is basically like a Spirit Vessel in terms of HP regen reduction. Use it against heroes who rely on healing,
				like Alchemist, Bloodseeker, Morphling, Necrophos, Timbersaw, etc.</li>
			<li>Brain Sap heals you for the same amount of damage you deal to a target. This means if you Brain Sap an illusion, you heal
				a ton because of the illusion damage multiplier.</li>
			<li>Bane can attack Nightmared units without waking them.</li>
			<li>No one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the
				Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga sleep. If anyone besides Bane right clicks this hero
				after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spells are
				used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will be dispelled.</li>
			<li>You can use the first second of complete immunity on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from
				being affected by any incoming projectiles.</li>
			<li>You dispel all active Nightmares when using the Nightmare End skill, including reflected Lotus Nightmares
				or Rubick Nightmares.</li>
			<li>Towers completely ignore creeps that are Nightmared. Consider Nightmaring an allied creep during a push
				to keep it alive whenever the enemy team uses Glyph.</li>
			<li>Like all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape to go
				invis during the channel.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip provides true sight on the target for the full duration of the channel.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><b>TAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES.</b> If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly
				migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmare'd
				ally.</li>
			<li>Use summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster Boars, Lycan Wolves, Brood Spiderlings,
				Nature's Prophet Treants, or illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the Nightmare.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to stop the channel on Bane's ult.</li>
			<li>Or save strong dispels. Things like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, Omniknight's
				Heavenly Grace, and Oracle's False Promise can purge Bane's ult off your allies.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb prevents Bane from casting Fiend's Grip on you without it getting canceled instantly.</li>
			<li>Rubick is a common counter to Bane since Fiend's Grip is a guaranteed steal, but Nightmare also has an
				interesting interaction with Rubick. If Bane and Rubick both have a Nightmare out, anyone who casts the
				Nightmare End sub-spell will end <i>all</i> active Nightmares.</li>
