		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enfeeble is outrageous early game. It's tempting to spend a majority of your mana constantly Brain
				Sapping, but it can be more useful to completely stop your lane enemy from getting a single last hit
				rather than forcing them to use and buy regen.</li>
			<li>No one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the
				Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga sleep. If anyone right clicks this hero
				after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spell is
				used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will not be transferred.</li>
			<li>You can use that first second of complete immunity on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from
				taking any damage.</li>
			<li>Nightmare can be used to deny allies or yourself since it applies a very small DoT.</li>
			<li>You can dispel Nightmares by using the Nightmare End skill.</li>
			<li>Like all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape to go
				invis during the channel or you can activate BKB.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES. If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly
				migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmare'd
				ally.</li>
			<li>Use summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster boar, Lycan wolf,
				Brood spiderling, or Prophet treant, even illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the
				Nightmare.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to break the channel on Bane's ult.</li>
			<li>Or save strong Dispels. Things like Aphotic Shield, Press the Attack, and False Promise can purge Bane's
				ult off your allies.</li>
