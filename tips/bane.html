		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enfeeble reduces enemy cast range on items in addition to spells.</li>
			<li>Brain Sap heals you for the same amount of damage you deal to a target. This means if you Brain Sap an illusion, you heal
				a ton because of the illusion damage multiplier.</li>
			<li>Brain Sap fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>No one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the
				Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga Song sleep. If anyone besides Bane right clicks this hero
				after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spells are
				used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will be dispelled.
				<ul><li>Bane can damage Nightmared units with spells, items, or attacks without waking them.</li>
					<li>Nightmared targets can get hit by Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist, Kunkka's Tidebringer, or Phantom Assassin's Stifling Dagger
					and still not wake up for some reason.</li></ul>
			<li>You can use the first second of invulnerability on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from
				being affected by any incoming projectiles or damaging/debuffing spells.
				<ul><li>Debuff immune targets also receive the invulnerability period. So if you Nightmare a BKB'd ally (or enemy), they can
					even briefly act in a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.</li></ul>
			<li>If you have an active Nightmare out, you can dispel all other active Nightmares with Nightmare End, including reflected Lotus Nightmares
				or Rubick Nightmares.
				<ul><li>However, you <i>cannot</i> use Nightmare End if Anti-Mage Counterspells your Nightmare. This is because you don't
				'own' any of the Nightmares that are out. Be very careful when trying to Nightmare an Anti-Mage.</li></ul>
			<li>You can cast Nightmare End without interrupting channels, like during Fiend's Grip or TPs. You can even cast Nightmare End
				while you're stunned.</li>
			<li>Towers completely ignore creeps that are Nightmared. Consider Nightmaring an allied creep during a push
				to keep it alive whenever the enemy team uses Glyph.
				<ul><li>You can try using Nightmare to save a siege creep that's about to go on a solo mission straight into an enemy tower.</li></ul>
			<li>Creeps completely ignore Nightmared targets. If an enemy hero is try to cut creep waves, putting them to sleep will get your
				creeps back on track to the lane.</li>
			<li>Casting Fiend's Grip on an enemy will end Nightmare.</li>
			<li>Like all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape to go
				invis during the Fiend's Grip channel.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip provides true sight on the target for the full duration of the channel.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip can be used to stun couriers, but won't damage them.</li>
			<li>Bane has 1200 night vision. This is higher than the typical 800 night vision that most heroes have.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><i>TAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES.</i> If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly
				migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmared
				ally.
				<ul><li>Whenever Nightmare is transferred, the new target will be slept for the full Nightmare duration again.</li>
				<li>If you're debuff immune/BKB'd consider taking Nightmare off an ally (or enemy). The Nightmare
					debuff will be transferred to you, but chances are someone besides Bane will damage you and dispel the Nightmare.
					What's even better is if an enemy besides Bane tries to right click you, they'll get Nightmared.</li></ul>
			<li>Use summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster Boars, Lycan Wolves, Brood Spiderlings,
				Nature's Prophet Treants, or illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the Nightmare.</li>
			<li>Fiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to stop the channel on Bane's ult.
			<ul><li>Or save strong dispels. Things like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, 
				and Oracle's False Promise can dispel Bane's ult off your allies.</li></ul>
			<li>Disruptor's Glimpse is a long range and convenient way to cancel Fiend's Grip.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb prevents Bane from casting Fiend's Grip on a target without it getting canceled instantly.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb has an interesting interaction with Nightmare. If you attempt to take Nightmare off a target while
				you have an active Lotus Orb on your hero, the Nightmare will transfer to you and <i>also</i> apply a Nightmare to Bane.
				Most of the time this isn't useful since Bane can end Nightmares and get out of the disable, but if he's in the middle of a Fiend's Grip channel,
				you could potentially interrupt it using this mechanic.</li>
			<li>Rubick is a common counter to Bane since Fiend's Grip is a guaranteed steal, but Nightmare also has an
				interesting interaction with Rubick. If Bane and Rubick both have a Nightmare out, anyone who casts the
				Nightmare End sub-spell will end <i>all</i> active Nightmares.</li>
