		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hold on to the Shackle until you are sure you'll get a latch. If you can't find a good angle or secondary target to
				land a Shackle, just sit on it.</li>
			<li>For years man has wondered, "How <i>does</i> Shackleshot work?" A brave soul on /r/dota2 tackled one of the
				greatest mysteries of Dota and came <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3lgx2u/shackleshot_always_prioritises_units_over_trees/cv6be6h">back
					with the following findings.</a> tl;dr Shackleshot searches from 0° outwards and from
					furthest secondary target to closest secondary target.</li>
			<li>What sets good Windrangers apart from bad Windrangers is how frequently Shackles are cast on creeps. Bad
				Windrangers will almost always target it on a hero even if there's a far larger window to miss the
				latch. Shackleshot prioritizes units over trees, so casting it on creeps is often times safer than casting
				it on a hero and banking on a tree or another unit to show up.</li>
			<li>Shackleshot can latch to invisible units. If you know where an invisible target is (like TA in
				Meld), then you can try to position a creep in such a way that you can land the enemy hero as the
				secondary target.</li>
			<li>Use Powershot vision to scout Rosh attempts or check high ground fog.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Powershot's massive range can also be a liability at times. If you're farming in dangerous
				areas, be careful with your Powershot angles, otherwise enemies may discover you're farming their jungle.</li>
			<li>If you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Powershot.</li>
			<li>Windrun has a slowing component to the spell. If you're chasing someone down with your team, try to
				spend your entire Windrun within ~300 radius of the enemy (the radius of the slow).</li>
			<li>Windrun can disjoint all incoming attack projectiles.</li>
			<li>Focus Fire cannot be dispelled. Not the positive buff off you nor the debuff off your selected target. Not even through an Aegis
				death will the Focus Fire debuff be removed off a target.</li>
			<li>The only ways to stop attacking a Focus Fired target are to right click a different target, hit the stop or patrol keys,
				or just move out of attack range.</li>
			<li>When moving in Focus Fire, you will face the direction you're clicking in, but once you stop clicking, Windranger will turn around
				to face the enemy she's attacking. This is relevant when Focus Firing a Medusa Stone Gazing, so you can attack her and not get Stoned.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be very aware of her angle to you and any allied creeps between you and her in lane. Windrangers are always
				fishing for Shackles, so keep mirroring her movements to make it difficult.</li>
			<li>Constantly keep her in your camera when laning against her. Powershot is not an easy spell for her to
				land, but it is if you're asleep at the wheel. Watch where she's aiming and move away.</li>
			<li>Windrun gives 100% evasion against physical <i>attacks</i>, but physical <i>damage</i> can still hurt
				her. This includes spells like Diabolic Edict or Exorcism.</li>
			<li>Get an MKB or Bloodthorn to deal with Windrun evasion if Windranger is turning into a strong damage dealer.</li>
			<li>Or get a Nullifier. Windrun can be purged/dispelled.</li>
			<li>Windranger will Focus Fire under any circumstances when she can normally right click her target. If she's stunned, slept, 
				feared, ethereal, hexed, taunted, disarmed, or out of range, she won't attack.</li>
			<li>Focus Fire involves a bunch of small damage attacks in a quick period of time. This makes damage block items like Vanguard
				or Crimson Guard very effective at mitigating her damage.</li>
