		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hold on to the Shackle until you are sure you'll get a latch. If you can't find a good angle or secondary target to
				land a Shackle, just sit on it.</li>
			<li>For years man has wondered, "How <i>does</i> Shackleshot work?" Many years ago, Bu3ny tackled one of the
				greatest mysteries of Dota and came <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3lgx2u/shackleshot_always_prioritises_units_over_trees/cv6be6h">back
					with the following findings.</a> tl;dr Shackleshot searches from 0Â° outwards and from
					furthest secondary target to closest secondary target.</li>
			<li>Shackleshot calculates latch angles based on where it was originally cast, not from Windranger's current location.</li>
			<li>What sets good Windrangers apart from bad Windrangers is how frequently Shackles are cast on creeps. Bad
				Windrangers will almost always target it on a hero even if there's a far larger window to miss the
				latch. Shackleshot prioritizes units over trees, so casting it on creeps is often times safer than casting
				it on a hero and banking on a tree or another unit to show up.</li>
			<li>Shackleshot can latch to invisible units. If you know where an invisible target is (like a Templar Assassin in
				Meld), then you can try to position a creep in such a way that you can land the enemy hero as the
				secondary target.</li>
			<li>Use Powershot vision to scout Rosh attempts or check high ground fog.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Powershot's massive range can also be a liability at times. If you're farming in dangerous
				areas, be careful with your Powershot angles, otherwise enemies may discover you're farming their jungle.</li>
			<li>If you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Powershot.</li>
			<li>Windrun has a slowing component to the spell. If you're chasing someone down with your team, try to
				spend your entire Windrun keeping the enemy in the AoE of the slow.</li>
			<li>Windrun gives you 100% evasion from incoming attacks, including attacks from towers.</li>
			<li>Focus Fire cannot be dispelled. Not the positive buff off you nor the debuff off your selected target. Not even through an Aegis
				death will the Focus Fire debuff be removed off an enemy target.</li>
			<li>You can stop yourself from attacking a Focus Fired target by hitting the stop or halt key. If you right click on the target,
				it will resume again. Useful to know against Blade Mail carriers.</li>
			<li>When moving in Focus Fire, you will face the direction you're clicking in, but once you stop clicking, Windranger will turn around
				to face the enemy she's attacking. This is relevant when Focus Firing a Medusa Stone Gazing so you can attack her and not get Stoned.</li>
			<li>You cannot target ward type units (like Phoenix's Supernova, Pugna's Nether Ward, Undying's Tombstone) with Focus Fire.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be very aware of her angle to you and any allied creeps between you and her in lane. Windrangers are always
				fishing for Shackles, so keep mirroring her movements to make it difficult.</li>
			<li>Constantly keep her in your camera when laning against her. Powershot is not an easy spell for her to
				land, but it is if you're asleep at the wheel. Watch where she's aiming and move away.</li>
			<li>Windrun gives 100% evasion against physical <i>attacks</i>, but physical <i>damage</i> can still hurt
				her. This includes damage from spells like Leshrac's Diabolic Edict or Death Prophet's Exorcism.</li>
			<li>Get an MKB or Bloodthorn to deal with Windrun evasion.</li>
			<li>Or get a Nullifier or Eul's. Windrun can be purged/dispelled.</li>
			<li>Windranger will Focus Fire under any circumstances when she can normally right click her target. If she's stunned, slept, 
				feared, ethereal, hexed, taunted, disarmed, or out of range, she won't attack.</li>
			<li>Focus Fire involves a bunch of small damage attacks in a quick period of time. This makes damage block items like Vanguard
				or Crimson Guard very effective at mitigating her damage.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail can also make her think twice about wanting to Focus Fire you.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb can discourage Windranger from Focus Firing allies. If a melee hero reflects a Focus Fire, they'll need to be within
				350 + melee hero attack range (default 150) to land attacks on Windranger. Any further and the attacks will miss.</li>
