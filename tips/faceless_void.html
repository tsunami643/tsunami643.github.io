		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You're invulnerable when using Time Walk. While not always practical, you can use this to run head first
				into projectiles like Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to evade the stun or use the invulnerability period to dodge
				an AoE stun like Phoenix's Supernova.</li>
			<li>Tread switching is especially important to utilize on Void. Time Walk restores flat HP, so you stand to
				benefit a lot by switching to INT Treads for the mana and going back to STR/AGI after rewinding damage.</li>
			<li>Time Dilation makes Void a very annoying counter for heroes with low cooldown or combo spells like, Timbersaw,
				Bristleback, Invoker, Lina, Kunkka, Weaver, Queen of Pain, all the Spirit heroes, Terrorblade,
				Phantom Assassin, and Slark (as long as he doesn't Dark Pact the debuff off first).</li>
			<li>Time Lock attacks can proc anything that your normal right clicks do, including another Time Lock.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The guaranteed bashes with Agh's Scepter Time Walk do <i>not</i> trigger on spell immune enemies.</li>
			<li>Chronosphere reveals invisible units. If an enemy decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out,
				cast a Chrono along the path and laugh when you discover them without any sort of detection.</li>
			<li>Donkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will
				not freeze enemy couriers.</li>
			<li>Any units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere, such as illusions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast can prevent Void from regaining HP through Time Walk.</li>
			<li>Bane's Enfeeble also reduces health restoration.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel reduces the HP Void will gain in Time Walk. Shiva's and Skadi also reduce HP regen.</li>
			<li>Void cannot Time Walk when rooted.</li>
			<li>The Time Dilation debuff can be purged/dispelled.</li>
			<li>Eul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. You should be able to waste a good 2.5s of
				Chrono time by Cycloning him if you're outside the Chrono or you can use it on yourself if you're about to
				be Chrono'd.
				<ul><li>Wind Waker can also be used to protect an ally in Chrono. However, allies can't move themselves while Cycloned. Only a self-cast
				Wind Waker allows that.</li></ul>
			<li>Ghost Scepter can minimize the amount of physical damage you tank in a Chronosphere and later turning it into an Ethereal Blade can help
				save allies from dying to right clicks in a Chrono.</li>
			<li>Void can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to
				be tricky in Ability Draft.</li>
			<li>This means that enemy Void illusions created by Dark Seer's Wall of Replica or Shadow Demon's Disruption
				can also move around in Chronosphere.</li>
			<li>Ward units, like Witch Doctor's Death Ward or Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, are frozen when inside the Chronosphere.
				Weaver Swarm bugs will also instantly fall off and Gyrocopter's Homing Missile will explode when it touches the Chronosphere.
				Techies' Sticky Bomb will just straight up vanish if you cast it into a Chronosphere, however, it can drive into a Chronosphere
				just fine if you catch a hero on the edge.</li>
			<li>Zeus's Nimbus is the one exception since it works normally against Chrono. I guess it... floats over the Chrono
				or something.</li>
			<li>Monkey King's Wukong's Command works in any Chronosphere, allied or enemy.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>Faceless Void's "Backtrack" talent can be disabled by <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Break#Sources">breaks.</a></li>
