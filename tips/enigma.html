		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Converting allied creeps into Eidolons counts as a deny and will give you gold accordingly.</li>
			<li>You can make Eidolons out of Eidolons, thus further Horcruxing it. The cooldown for Conversion gives you
				about ~0.5s to quickly convert an Eidolon before it disappears. This information is highly relevant
				during Rosh attempts.</li>
			<li>Jungle creeps have a tendency to use their spells whenever three units are in close proximity to them.
				If you just converted something, chances are your Eidolons will eat the damage, but if you're moving to
				a new camp with old Eidolons, spread them out so they don't trigger a spell.</li>
			<li>You can avoid triggering a neutral spell by dragging the camp out and converting when the creeps are
				walking back to their camp.</li>
			<li>When jungling, be aware that you can drop neutral aggro off of your Eidolons the same way you can drop
				tower aggro. Select the Eidolon in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should
				lose interest in that Eidolon.</li>
			<li>Attacks on buildings or allied units do not increase the attack counter for Eidolon multiplication.</li>
			<li>However, if Eidolons only need <i>one</i> more attack before they multiply, a tower attack will work.
				I don't know why.</li>
			<li>You can convert enemy siege creeps into Eidolons to help speed up pushes.</li>
			<li>Midnight Pulse breaks trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees
				during a chase, stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King, or to be super sneaky and carve a path to hide so
				you can easily Blink in for huge Black Holes.</li>
			<li>If you're against a team with high mobility or lots of disables, don't bother with dropping the Midnight
				Pulse before Black Hole. The cast animation is long and makes this risky.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>"Hey guys don’t clump, I think Black Hole is off coo... GOD DAMN IT."</li>
			<li>Beastmaster is a solid pick against Enigma since he can stand on the other end of a Black Hole and still
				stun him out of BKB with Primal Roar. Vengeful Spirit is also a good pick since Nether Swap also
				penetrates spell immunity. Rubick can steal Black Hole guaranteed. Silencer can Global Silence a Black Hole
				even through BKB. Necro can also disable through spell immunity with Reaper's Scythe. KotL's Will-O-Wisp
				doesn't go through spell immunity, but it's still a super long range super huge AoE channel breaker.</li>
