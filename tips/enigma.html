		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Jungle creeps have a tendency to use their spells whenever three units are in close proximity to them.
				When jungling a neutral camp, spread your Eidolons out so they don't trigger the neutrals to use their spells.</li>
			<li>When jungling, be aware that you can drop neutral aggro off of your Eidolons the same way you can drop
				tower aggro. Select the Eidolon in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should
				lose interest in that Eidolon.</li>
			<li>Attacks on buildings or allied units do not increase the attack counter for Eidolon multiplication.
				<ul><li>However, if Eidolons only need <i>one</i> more attack before they multiply, a tower attack will work.
					I don't know why.</li></ul>
			<li>If you target Demonic Summoning on the very edge of a cliff top, you'll usually get a single Eidolon to spawn
				on the cliff and the other ones will spawn on the ground. Useful for dewarding or keeping vision without having to Cliffteezy
				all your Eidolons.</li>
			<li>Midnight Pulse breaks trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Nature's Prophet's Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees
				during a chase, stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King, or to be super sneaky and carve a path to hide so
				you can easily Blink in for huge Black Holes.</li>
			<li>Midnight Pulse deals full damage against debuff immune enemies.</li>
			<li>Midnight Pulse does not deal damage to Roshan.</li>
			<li>Multiple instances of Midnight Pulse do not stack.</li>
			<li>When going for solo kills with Black Hole in the early game, try to get a few multiplied Eidolons out first to make sure
				you have enough damage for a kill.</li>
			<li>Black Hole is a unique type of stun which also comes with a silence. In most situations, this doesn't really matter,
				but it does prevent Abaddon from being able to manually activate Borrowed Time or Ursa activating Agh's Scepter Enrage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>"Hey guys don't clump, I think Black Hole is off coo... GOD DAMN IT."</li>
			<li>A few choice heroes that are good at dealing with Black Hole:
				<ul>
				<li><b>Beastmaster</b> - Can stand on the other end of a Black Hole and still stun Enigma out of BKB with Primal Roar.
				<li><b>Rubick</b> - Can guaranteed Spell Steal Black Hole even through debuff immunity.
				<li><b>Silencer</b> - Global Silence cancels Black Hole even through debuff immunity.
				<li><b>Treant Protector</b> - Overgrowth can cancel Black Hole even through debuff immunity.
				<li><b>Clockwerk</b> - Hookshot is a long range debuff immunity piercing disable.
				<li><b>Pudge</b> - Meat Hook is a long range debuff immunity piercing disable.
				<li><b>Vengeful Spirit</b> - Nether Swap is a long range debuff immunity piercing disable.
				<li><b>Warlock</b> - Chaotic Offering is a long range debuff immunity piercing disable.
				<li><b>Winter Wyvern</b> - Winter's Curse is a long range debuff immunity piercing disable.
				</ul>
			<li>If you don't have any heroes who can break Black Hole, remember that Abyssal Blade's active can stun through debuff
				immunity as well. Obviously the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDh95jtcizg">passive bashes</a> from Basher or Abyssal
				will work too.</li>
			<li>Casting Wind Waker on an ally could potentially save them from certain late game Black Hole deaths.</li>
