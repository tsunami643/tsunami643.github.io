		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Many players don't notice that Dazzle's claim to fame is that all of his spells revolve around physical
				 damage. Poison Touch ticks physically, Shadow Wave heals and deals damage physically, and Dazzle's Weave innate is all
				 about mitigating armor values. SUCH SYNERGY.</li>
			<li>Poison Touch will only potentially spread to targets in a cone that are within ~500 units of the
				primary target.</li>
			<li>Poison Touch when cast from the Nothl Projection applies a hex on all units hit. The hex is extremely effective at quickly instagibbing a bunch of illusions.</li>
			<li></span><span class="facet"></span>Additional Poison Touch projectiles provided by the "Poison Bloom" facet
				will also proc the Nothl Projection Poison Touch hex.</li>
			<li>Be smart about using heals post-Shallow Grave. I'm fine if you Grave someone at 50% HP because at least
				you're trying. Just don't waste heals on a 1 HP Shallow Graved ally when there are 4 seconds left on the
				Grave clock. Wait for the ring around them to drop to the ground (that's the visual showing when Shallow Grave ends) and then
				immediately burst heal them. You're wasting precious healing potential by healing someone who's safe and is
				going to get that HP burned off during the Grave anyway.</li>
			<li>If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Shallow Grave by
				clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.</li>
			<li>For some reason you can Shallow Grave illusions. Mind game potential too strong.
				<ul><li>You can also Shallow Grave creep-heroes like Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's
					Primal Split Brewlings.</li></ul>
			<li>Shallow Grave to an immediate TP can get you out of nearly every gank situation early game unless you're
				against some sort of disable heavy Mirana, Shadow Shaman, Lion lane.</li>
			<li>Dazzle has a instance of damage around himself when Shadow Wave is cast. When pushing, stand in the
				middle of enemy creeps to take advantage of this.</li>
			<li>You can cast Shadow Wave on couriers, but the spell won't heal them.</li>
			<li>Always be on the look out for "heal bombs." If an enemy is standing close to a bunch of your team's units, like
				lane creeps or summons or illusions, Shadow Wave can potentially deal a ton of damage to them.</li>
			<li>You can't directly target allies who are cycloned with Shadow Wave, but a heal can still bounce to them.</li>
			<li>Some Nothl Projection mechanics:
				<ul><li>Functionally, Dazzle's body and the Projection are two separate units. Think of it as if the body is an Arc Warden that's permastunned
						and the Projection is a Tempest Double.</li>
					<li>The Projection copies Dazzle's items on spawn. Cooldowns are shared, there's no real trickery possible.</li>
					<li>Projection item copying also shares a lot of rules with the Tempest Double. For example, the Projection does not copy
						consumable items, Gem, or Rapier. Basher doesn't work. And any neutral item that has a right click effect with a cooldown
						won't apply with the Projection.</li>
					<li>Two exceptions to Tempest Double similarities: The Projection can't use Midas. The Projection can copy and use Refresher Orb.</li>
					<li>You can cast Eul's Cyclone on Dazzle's body from the Projection.</li>
					<li>Aura items will stay on your hero and a copy will follow your Projection.</li>
					<li>The Projection copies Dazzle's HP/mana pool on spawn, but then uses its own pool.</li>
					<li>The Projection is completely invulnerable. It can't take damage, can't be debuffed, and is untargetable by
						enemies/allies/self. To give an example of how invulnerable it is, it is completely unaffected by Faceless Void's Chronosphere.</li>
					<li>..."can't be debuffed" isn't entirely accurate, though. A few spells <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Invulnerability#Affecting_Invulnerable_Units">
						do affect invulnerable units:</a> Disruptor's Static Storm, Dark Seer's Wall of Replica, and Silencer's Global Silence are a few notable examples.</li>
					<li>The Projection can receive allied auras and ground targeted buffs.</li>
					<li>The tether pullback is not a hard limit. The Projection can Blink or move past the limit (like with a TP), but
						it'll be tugged back faster the further away it is from Dazzle's body. The higher the move speed of the Projection,
						the more it can resist the pullback.</li>
					<li>The Projection can walk through trees, but does not have free pathing over cliffs.</li>
					</ul>
			<li>Rules on what the Nothl Projection can interact with on the map:
				<ul>
				<li>The Nothl Projection can activate and use every type of rune.</li>
				<li>The Nothl Projection <i>cannot</i> activate Lotus Pools, Outposts, Watchers, or Twin Gates.</li>
				<li>The Nothl Projection can activate Shrines of Wisdom and the primary experience will go to Dazzle.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can deny allies affected by Poison Touch.</li>
			<li>Don't aimlessly walk into a wave of enemy creeps if you're going for a kill on Dazzle. One Shadow Wave
				will quickly tear you apart, especially if you have low armor.</li>
			<li>The HP Dazzle heals with spells like Shadow Wave can only be reduced by sources that manipulate <i>incoming heals</i>:
				<ul><li>Debuffs that can reduce incoming heals: Spirit Vessel, Eye of Skadi, and Shiva's Guard.</li>
					<li>To clarify, the 'incoming heal' manipulation mechanic differs from generic 'health restoration' manipulation.
						Health restoration comes from sources like lifesteal or just passive HP/s increases (like from Tango, Healing Salve,
						Alchemist's Chemical Rage, or Morphling STR Attribute Shifting). These can be reduced by things like Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia
						or Orb of Corrosion.</li>
					<li>However, heals that come from burst sources like Magic Wand, Healing Lotus, Dazzle's Shadow Wave,
						Omniknight's Purification or incremental heals like Oracle's Purifying Flames, Phoenix's Sun Ray, or Pugna's Life Drain are <i>not</i> considered
						'health restoration' but instead 'incoming heals.'</li>
					<li>If you're not sure what type of HP regen a debuff manipulates, the tooltip needs to say it affects 'health restoration' <i>and</i> 'incoming heals.'
						Spirit Vessel, for example, states both.</li>
					<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom also prevent enemies from gaining any HP.</li>
					<li>Ice Blast won't kill/shatter someone who's Shallow Graved, but Dazzle can't heal them up to protect them.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Axe's Culling Blade can kill through Shallow Grave.
				<ul><li>Culling Blade is the only "instant kill" spell that can kill through Shallow Grave. This is because a lethal Culling Blade
					specifically removes the Shallow Grave buff from the target and <i>then</i> kills them. Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, in comparison,
					will attempt to deal lethal damage to a target who is in Shatter range, but the Shallow Grave buff will prevent them from going below 1 HP.</li></ul>
			<li>Shallow Grave ends when the ring falling around the hero touches the ground.</li>
			<li>Eul's can potentially be used to kill 1 HP Shallow Graved targets since Dazzle can't easily heal them when they're
				cycloned and the damage from Eul's will be lethal.</li>
			<li>Dazzle's Nothl Projection is completely invulnerable and untargetable. You can't stun/silence/damage it with most spells, you just need to trace
				the tether and kill his body.
				<ul><li>Disruptor's Static Storm and Silencer's Global Silence go through invulnerability and can silence the Projection.</li></ul>
