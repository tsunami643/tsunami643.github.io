		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Many players don't notice that Dazzle's claim to fame is that all of his spells revolve around physical
				 damage. Poison Touch ticks physically, Shadow Wave heals and deals damage physically, and Bad Juju is all
				 about mitigating armor values. SUCH SYNERGY.</li>
			<li>Poison Touch refreshes on all right clicks including attacks from lane creeps and summons.</li>
			<li>Poison Touch will only potentially spread to targets in a cone that are within ~500 units of the
				primary target.</li>
			<li>Be smart about using heals post-Shallow Grave. I'm fine if you Grave someone at 50% HP because at least
				you're trying. Just don't waste heals on a 1 HP Shallow Graved ally when there are 4 seconds left on the
				Grave clock. Wait for the ring around them to drop to the ground and then
				immediately Mek+Shadow Wave them and watch the enemies freak out. You're wasting precious healing
				potential by healing someone who's safe and is going to get that HP burned off inevitably anyway.</li>
			<li>If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Shallow Grave by
				clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.</li>
			<li>For some reason you can Shallow Grave illusions. Mind game potential too strong.</li>
			<li>Shallow Grave to an immediate TP can get you out of nearly every gank situation early game unless you're
				against some sort of Mirana, Rhasta, Lion lane.</li>
			<li>Dazzle has a instance of damage around himself when Shadow Wave is cast. When pushing, stand in the
				middle of enemy creeps to take advantage of this.</li>
			<li>Shadow Wave healing and damage both work through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>You can heal couriers with Shadow Wave.</li>
			<li>You can't directly target allies who are Cycloned with Shadow Wave, but a heal can still bounce to them.</li>
			<li>Shadow Wave can bounce to ET's Astral Spirit even though the Spirit can't be directly targeted.</li>
			<li>Bad Juju armor reduction will apply to units that are in fog. This can sometimes give up your position
				if you're sneaking around enemy territory.</li>
			<li>Solar Crest's self-armor reduction is tied to its cooldown. This allows Dazzle to get his armor back faster
				after casting it on a target thanks to Bad Juju cooldown reduction.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't aimlessly walk into a wave of enemy creeps if you're going for a kill on Dazzle. One Shadow Wave
				will quickly tear you apart, especially if you have low armor.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition makes life hard for Dazzle (and other healers) with Ice Blast. Ice Blast won't
				kill/shatter someone who's Graved, but Dazzle can't heal them up to protect them.</li>
			<li>Culling Blade kills through Shallow Grave.</li>
			<li>Shallow Grave ends when the ring falling around the hero touches the ground.</li>
			<li>Eul's can potentially be used to kill 1 HP Shallow Graved targets since Dazzle can't easily heal them when they're
				Cycloned and the damage from Eul's will be lethal.</li>
			<li>Bad Juju keeps adding up over time. Just because you're doing fine in the first few seconds of a team fight
				doesn't mean you'll hold up as well when you're at -5 armor. Make team fights snappy when fighting
				against a Dazzle.</li>
