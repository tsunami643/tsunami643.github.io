		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For some reason the targeting cursor doesn't show it and the tooltip doesn't mention it, but Fatal Bonds
				does have a logic to how it chooses secondary Bonds. Basically, it'll search for the nearest unit (any unit,
				including neutrals and units in fog) within 700 range. Once it finds a unit, it'll continue searching in another
				700 range around the new target until it runs out of bounces or runs out of targets.</li>
			<li>Damage shared through Fatal Bonds is dealt with the same damage type as the original source of damage. The shared damage
				calculates reductions (from armor or magic resistance) independently on each target.</li>
			<li>Damage taken through Fatal Bonds can disable Blink Daggers.</li>
			<li>"Overkill" damage on Fatally Bonded targets will spread the full damage of the killing damage instance. So if Lina
				Laguna Blades a Fatally Bonded 10HP ranged creep, the full Laguna Blade damage will still spread to all other Bonded targets.</li>
			<li>You get a better heal for your buck than the DoT with Shadow Word because healing ignores magic
				resistance. Warlock's damage/animation/range are so good you could possibly end up being able to deal
				more net damage by spending the heal on yourself in lane and right clicking the enemy.</li>
			<li>You can use Shadow Word to heal your Golem. You can also use Urn of Shadows to heal it. Hell,
				you can Salve, Bottle, or even Clarity it too.</li>
			<li>Upheaval is a proactive slow, not a reactive one. This makes it a great area denial spell.
				You just need to predict where enemies want to go in the next five seconds.</li>
			<li>This also makes it a good spell for discouraging encounters. If your team is Roshing, don't sit there
				plinking away with your weak ass auto attacks. Start channeling your slow on a choke point. If you think
				the enemy team is about to push up high ground, start channeling Upheaval on the stairs. If your
				teammate is getting chased, cast the circle in front of their path from a safe distance so you can get
				some charge time on the slow. Even if you cancel it immediately, as long as an enemy walked into it, they
				will be slowed for 3 seconds.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Upheaval Attack Speed on Allies" talent works on allied creeps and summons.</li>
			<li>When you drop the Golem on the enemy team and win the fight, remember to keep using it. The Golem is
				especially good at cutting off a creep wave during a tower push since its Flaming Fist ability deals
				damage in an AoE.</li>
			<li>Don't feed your Golem though. It drops a substantial gold bounty. Deny it if you have to.</li>
			<li>The stun from Chaotic Offering pierces spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Try to get your allies to cast buffs on your Golem during the game. Examples: Dark Seer's Surge or Ion Shell,
				Legion Commander's Press the Attack, Lich's Frost Shield, Magnus's Empower, Invoker's Alacrity, Ogre Magi's Bloodlust,
				Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, and Mjollnir's Static Shield are a few choice examples that make the Golem especially deadly.
				Even Dazzle can Shallow Grave the Golem.</li>
			<li>The Golem has 1800 night vision.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Summon Golem on Death" talent won't summon a Golem for an Aegis death, only a real death.</li>
			<li>A fantastic hero to get a Refresher on since Fatal Bonds and Shadow Word fully stack when Refreshed.
				I guess two Golems is pretty handy too.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay attention to who's Fatally Bonded to you in the late game. You may inadvertently be killing your
				support who narrowly escaped just because you wanted to finish off Rosh.</li>
			<li>Fatal Bonds can be dispelled. Offensive or defensive Shadow Word can both be purged off as well.</li>
			<li>The strength of Upheaval's slow isn't determined by how long you've been standing in it, but by how long
				Warlock has been channeling it. Don't think you can just quickly run into an established Upheaval and get out.</li>
			<li>Warlock's Golem can be affected by Breaks.</li>
