		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shuriken will bounce to Tracked targets even if the initial target isn't Tracked. Try hitting a
				non-Tracked unit first (like a creep) to reach a distant target.</li>
			<li>Manually casting Jinada on an enemy hero will not draw aggro from creeps.</li>
			<li>Shadow Walk has a visible cast animation, even if you're invisible when you cast it. If your invis is
				about to run out and you're quietly following someone, run into the fog to recast it, otherwise the
				enemy hero will see a random dust cloud appear at your location.</li>
			<li>Shadow Walk has a brief fade time at all levels. If you attack something during the fade time, you'll
				get the movement speed slow without dispelling your invis. The fade time is only long enough for this to work
				at early levels of Shadow Walk, though.</li>
			<li>Like all invis spells, you can cast Shadow Walk while you're channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>Also like all invis spells, you can pick up, drop, or attack items without losing invis.</li>
			<li>You can purge off Dust detection with basic dispels, like from Eul's, or Guardian Greaves, or Lotus Orb.</li>
			<li>If you're prowling around a lane that you think might be sentry warded, try intentionally forcing
				creep aggro while invis by right clicking an enemy hero anywhere on the map. If the creeps aggro you,
				then they can obviously see you.</li>
			<li>Another way to confirm is through heroes who go into 'attack stances' like Brew, Jugg, Abaddon, or listening
				to see if enemies say deny lines even though there is no one else in your lane. If these things happen for no
				good reason, they can see you.</li>
			<li>Casting Track doesn't break Shadow Walk invisibility, but does break other sources of invis.</li>
			<li>All attacks from your hero on a Tracked target have a crit multiplier.</li>
			<li>Hover over the Track debuff icon on an enemy to see how much gold they have. You can alt-click the debuff to
				announce it to your teammates.</li>
			<li>You can earn Track gold off Aegis deaths.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Many (bad) Bounty Hunters will blow Shuriken the second they start ganking you. If they do, just TP out
				now that he can't cancel your channel.</li>
			<li>Manta Style, Satanic, Eul's, Lotus Orb, and Guardian Greaves can all dispel Track. Slark's Dark Pact, Naga's Mirror Image,
				Phantom Lancer's Doppelganger can also purge Track. Allied targeted purges/dispels like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield,
				Legion Commander's Press the Attack, and Oracle's Fortune's End also work.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to your buff icons when there's a BH on the enemy team. You can't see the giant flare when
				it's on you, but you can see the Tracked icon in your buffs.</li>
			<li><b>Watch your courier.</b> Watch the path it takes when it's coming to you, watch the path it takes going back,
				route it over trees, don't send it over commonly warded cliffs, conduct your business quickly at the secret shop,
				know when the shield and speed bursts are available, and <i>don't let Bounty constantly snipe your donkey.</i></li>
			<li>Track gold adds up quickly and is what allows teams with softer carries than yours to wipe you out.
				Bounties LOVE trades because even though it seems like a 1:1 kill, it's more like a 1.5:1 gold kill.</li>
			<li>Bounty is at his strongest in the mid game when teams are separated and still squishy, so take
				initiative with detection. As opposed to other invis heroes like Clinkz and Nyx, Bounty doesn't get any
				bonus move speed from his Shadow Walk, which makes him easy pickings if you Dust him or if he bumbles
				into a sentry warded area.</li>
