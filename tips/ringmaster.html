		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Tame the Beasts Grants Debuff Immunity" does turn you debuff immune, but does not provide any kind of dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li>Tame the Beasts's fear will always cause enemies to run away in the direction opposite from Ringmaster's position. You can't fear an enemy to run into your hero no matter
				where they get hit by the whip's AoE, they'll always run away.</li>
			<li>Tame the Beasts and Impalement Arts can damage fogged and invis units.</li>
			<li>Mechanically, think of Escape Act like placing Dark Willow's Shadow Realm on an ally. They can still be damaged and debuffed by ground targeted abilities,
				but unit targeted abilities and instant attacks can't hit them.</li>
			<li>The Escape Act buff disjoints any incoming projectiles on the target.</li>
			<li>Allies won't be able to target a unit in Escape Act.</li>
			<li>Escape Act can be targeted on illusions, clones, and creep-heroes.</li>
			<li>If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Escape Act by clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.</li>
			<li>The Impalement Arts projectile gives vision as it travels.</li>
			<li>Multiple Impalement Arts <i>do not stack</i> on the same target. You'll get the impact damage for each new knife, but it'll only refresh the existing DoT debuff if
				you re-Impale a target that's currently being stabbed.</li>
			<li>The cast range on Impalement Arts is slightly longer than the maximum aggro range for neutral creeps. If you're trying to stack a camp with a dagger,
				you'll need to be within 1800 range of the camp for it to aggro you. Otherwise, they'll just sit in their spawn box contentedly being stabbed.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Spotlight deals bonus damage against illusions.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Spotlight provides vision in the circle AoEs and can briefly reveal invisible enemies that are caught.</li>
			<li>Bumping an enemy with the Wheel of Wonder rollout does <i>not</i> count as a disable. You'll have to get them caught in the taunt to stun them.</li>
			<li>Wheel of Wonder destroys trees as it travels and at its ending location.</li>
			<li>Enemies need to be able to see the Wheel to get taunted by it. As tempting as it may look to drag the entire enemy team up on a cliff, it's risky casting Wheels there.
				Even if they look like they're facing it, it needs to be out of their fog of war to activate it.</li>
			<li>Tame the Beasts's fear gives you some control over what direction enemies are facing. Toss the Wheel of Wonder behind an enemy and then hit them with Tame
				the Beasts so they turn around and stare into the Wheel to maximize disable time.</li>
			<li>The Wheel of Wonder provides ground vision wherever it lands with the same day/night radius numbers as the average hero as well as flying vision over its damage AoE.</li>
			<li>Mechanically, Souvenirs behave as items, not spells. This means that you can cast Souvenirs while silenced (but not when muted) and Rubick can't steal Souvenirs.</li>
			<li>You will not get a Souvenir if you deny yourself to Roshan or neutral creeps.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>"Carny Classics" facet Souvenir tips:
				<ul><li>Funhouse Mirror is similar to a Manta Style activation in that it disjoints incoming projectiles and you can 'absorb' spells during the cast animation.
					However, you <i>do not</i> receive a dispel as you would with a Manta Style.</li>
					<li>You can't cast Whoopee Cushion while rooted or leashed.</li>
					<li>Strongman Tonic can be dispelled.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>"Sideshow Secrets" facet Souvenir tips:
				<ul><li>Enemies can see your Crystal Ball particle effect anywhere on the map if their camera is hovering over it, but the scan icon won't show up in their minimap.</li>
					<li>Crystal Ball detection triggers on enemy illusions.</li>
					<li>Crystal Ball detection does not trigger on enemy wards. It provides true sight over the AoE, but it won't alert you if there are wards.</li>
					<li>Riding the Unicycle is like a very fragile Pangolier Rolling Thunder. Any map cliffs Pango would "bounce" into will instead dismount your
						Unicycle. Additionally, enemy units and enemy structures also dismount you.</li>
					<li>You can activate most items while riding the Unicycle, but applying movement items to yourself like Blink Dagger, Force Staff, or TP scroll
						will dismount you.</li>
					<li>You can dismount the Unicycle at any time by pressing the 'stop' hotkey.</li>
					<li>You can pick up runes on the Unicycle, but an illusion rune activation will dismount you because it's also a banish.</li>
					<li>Weighted Pie instantly kills any non-ancient creep.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Enemies can still be damaged and debuffed while in the Escape Act box by ground targeted abilities. Visually, they look invulnerable like in Tusk Snowball, but in actuality,
				it's more like they're in Dark Willow Shadow Realm.</li>
			<li>You can knock the Escape Act box with forced movement spells like Clockwerk's Power Cogs or Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light to bump them
				out of the protection circle AoE.</li>
			<li>Escape Act can be dispelled. This is relevant if you have a Nullifier, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, or have access
				to ground targeted dispels like Brewmaster's Primal Split Dispel Magic or Oracle's Fortune's End.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Impalement Art daggers that emit from an Escape Act once Ringmaster has Agh's Scepter always
				shoot out the same way. If you're trying to dodge them, they're going to travel all eight cardinal and intercardinal directions
				at the same angles every time.</li>
			<li>The Impalement Arts dagger projectile provides vision as it flies and briefly once it hits you, but the vision disappears when it
				starts stabbing you.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Ringmaster can cast any of his Souvenirs while silenced.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>The Strongman Tonic souvenir can be dispelled off targets.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>The Crystal Ball souvenir does not provide vision, but Ringmaster can track the little starburst particle effect under your
				hero when you're in the Ball AoE.</li>
