		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You will lose all Arcane Orb intelligence stacks on death, including deaths from Aegis. The enemies
				will still be missing their stats, however.</li>
			<li>You can put Roshan in Astral jail.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked in the early game, try using a Bottle charge or some sort of regen item right
				before self-Imprisoning yourself. The regen will continue healing while you're banished.</li>
			<li>You can cancel enemy (or ally) Boots of Travels by Imprisoning the unit that's being teleported on. This is actually true
				of all banishes, meaning that any target that gets banished while a TP is being channeled on them will cancel the TP.
				So for future reference don't activate a Manta Style if an ally is using Boots of Travel 2 on your hero.</li>
			<li>The Imprisonment ends when the orange circle at the top fully expands. If your team has spells that can
				combo with Astral, keep this in mind. This won't be accurate against heroes with status resistance, however.</li>
			<li>Activate Equilibrium right before the Astral ends so you don't waste valuable buff time while the Imprisonment
				isn't dealing any spell damage.</li>
			<li>Equilibrium provides mana based off any spell damage dealt from your hero, including damage from items.</li>
			<li>If an enemy team comp is very mana-intensive, use Sanity's Eclipse early on in a team fight to take advantage
				of the mana burn. If they're not and you'd rather get more damage, steal some INT with Arcane Orb first
				before casting Sanity's Eclipse.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nyx nyx nyx nyx. Mana Burn is the most anti-OD spell in the game since it deals damage based on the enemy's INT value.</li>
			<li>Pugna pugna pugna pugna. Nether Ward is the second most anti-OD spell in the game with how much mana Arcane Orb costs.</li>
			<li>Bkb bkb bkb bkb. Spell immunity is the most anti-OD state in the game since his Orb doesn't work on spell immune targets.</li>
			<li>Silence silence silence silence. OD is one of the most useless carries when silenced since the majority of
				his damage is coming from casting Arcane Orb.</li>
			<li>Equilibrium can be dispelled, making heroes like Oracle or Shadow Demon with Demonic Purge valuable in teamfights.</li>
			<li>Heals from items like Greaves, Mek, or Magic Wand are applied before Astral damage takes place allowing you
				to survive potentially lethal Imprisonments. Casting Hood/Pipe/BKB will also allow you to Blink out of Astral once it ends since
				the damage can be avoided.</li>
