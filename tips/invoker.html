		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember to change your orbs for their passive uses during the game. A lot of Invokers like to have their next spell
				Pre-Voked, but those 3 Wex orbs can make the difference between you catching up to an enemy or not or those 3 Quas
				orbs early on could save your life mid.</li>
			<li>Cold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel Bottle charges on the enemy mid from a distance if you
				have vision of them.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows can trigger a Cold Snap every ~0.5s.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell
				and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of ruining teammate spells.</li>
			<li>Tornado serves as a basic dispel on enemies which allows you to <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_buffs">
				purge</a> a variety of things including runes.</li>
			<li>I remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the
				<b>W-W-E Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</b></li>
			<li>Alacrity can be cast on creeps, siege creeps, and summons (like Forge Spirits).</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging
				and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Spawn a Forge Spirit around 20
				seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.</li>
			<li>Ghost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to QQ... W.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke because that'll cancel
				a channel.</li>
			<li>Don't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally,
				you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a
				gank situation.</li>
			<li>Ice Wall is actually ridiculous in the mid lane matchup. With 3 points in Quas it's a 60% slow. If
				someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get
				even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.</li>
			<li>With practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies. It's effectively a 650
				range slow if you can aim it right.</li>
			<li>The disarm of Deafening Blast can only be dispelled by spell immunity. If you hit an enemy with it, they can't
				take off the debuff with a strong dispel like Dark Pact, they can only take it off by activating BKB. The knockback can't be
				dispelled by anything.</li>
			<li>Sun Strike is useful for more than just sniping low HP heroes or comboing with Deafening Blast. Use it before the game even begins in the enemy
				fountain to try to scout out lane setups based on items. Scoop a ranged creep last hit in the first creep wave or later in the game
				when you're just chilling regening in the fountain. Use the vision to scout out Rosh, runes, or jungle stacks.</li>
			<li>Blind Sun Strikes are always hype, but you can consider using your team's Scan to assist with the timing.</li>
			<li>The "Catacylsm" talent is cast when Sun Strike is doubled tapped. It puts Sun Strike on a 90 second cooldown and
				creates 2 visible Sun Strikes within 175-250 range of each enemy hero.</li>
			<li>Catacylsm can be useful to locate enemy hero locations in the late game, similar to how a Zeus would casually
				use Thundergod's Wrath. This is highly relevant if you suspect the enemy team has smoked.</li>
			<li>Learn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos
				Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike, Ice Wall+Being the
				greatest spell in Voker's arsenal that is criminally underused.</li>
			<li>Illusions will copy whatever orb configuration your hero has when they spawn. They benefit from Wex move/attack speed and 
				Quas regen, but don't get anything from Exort because illusions can't use '+green' damage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's
				building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been
				going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.</li>
			<li>Try to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game,
				rather than after.</li>
			<li>Heals from items like Greaves, Mek, or Magic Wand are applied before Tornado damage takes place allowing you
				to survive potentially lethal Tornadoes. Casting Hood/Pipe/BKB may allow you to Blink out of a low-level Tornado when you land.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to
				be annoying. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for any follow up right clicks.</li>
			<li>For the love of everything, please bring some sort of detection when trying to gank Invoker. Ghost Walk is
				<i>not</i> a good escape, dude needs 4 points minimum in Wex to not slow himself.</li>
