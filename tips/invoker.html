		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember to change your orbs for their passive uses before casting a spell. A lot of Invokers keep their next spell Pre-Voked,
				but Quas orbs change the spell lifesteal, Wex orbs change the cooldown reduction, and Exort orbs change the
				spell amplification of each spell upon casting.
				<ul><li>Certain spells don't benefit from Quas/Exort orbs. You always want to have 3 Wexes active
					before casting Alacrity, Forge Spirits, or Ghost Walk.</li>
					<li>Illusions will copy whatever orbs your hero has when they spawn. The only orb configuration they'll benefit from
					are 3 Wex orbs for the move speed.</li></ul>
			<li>Cold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel consumable health regen on the enemy mid from a distance if you
				have vision of them.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows on an enemy can trigger a Cold Snap every second.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell
				and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of ruining teammate spells.</li>
			<li>Tornado serves as a basic <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Dispel">dispel</a> which allows you to
				remove most buffs off enemies including runes.</li>
			<li>You can stack certain neutral camps with Tornado. This only works on <i>some</i> camps,
				however. The reason is because Tornado raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights.
				You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the <font face="courier new">-spawnneutrals</font> command with cheats enabled)
				to see which camps work and which ones don't.</li>
			<li>Tornado prevents targets from being attacked. This means towers can't aggro units that are being Tornado'd. You can leverage this
				to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ZFx7y3ZlE">force the tower to swap aggro to a hero</a> by Tornadoing a creep wave,
				but <i>not</i> the enemy hero in tower range.</li>
			<li>I remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the
				<b>W-W-E Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</b></li>
			<li>Alacrity can be cast on creeps, siege creeps, and summons (like Forged Spirits).</li>
			<li>Forged Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging
				and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.</li>
			<li>Forged Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Cast Forge Spirits around 20
				seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.</li>
			<li>Ghost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to
				<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QQ">QQ</a>... W.</li>
			<li>Ghost Walk HP/mana regen is disabled if you've taken player-controlled damage in the last 3 seconds.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke because that'll cancel
				a channel.</li>
			<li>Don't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally,
				you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a
				gank situation.</li>
			<li>Ice Wall can be surprisingly effective in the mid lane matchup. If
				someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get
				even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.</li>
			<li>With practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies.</li>
			<li>The disarm of Deafening Blast can only be bypassed by activating debuff immunity/BKB. If you hit an enemy with it, they can't
				take off the debuff even with a strong dispel like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, they can ignore it by activating BKB. The knockback can't be
				dispelled by anything.</li>
			<li>Sun Strike is useful for more than just sniping low HP heroes or comboing with Deafening Blast. Scoop a ranged creep last hit in the first
				creep wave or later in the game when you're just chilling regening in the fountain. Use the vision to scout out Rosh, runes, or jungle stacks.</li>
			<li>Tormentors damage whatever hero hits them globally. If you're trying to escape enemies at critical HP, a big brain play could be denying yourself
				to a Tormentor by Sun Striking it.</li>
			<li>Blind Sun Strikes are always hype, but you can consider using your team's Scan to assist with the timing.</li>
			<li>Sun Strike damage fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Cataclysm ability granted by Agh's Scepter can be cast when Sun Strike is doubled tapped. It puts Sun Strike on a longer cooldown and
				creates 2 visible Sun Strikes (the enemy can see them) within 175-250 range of each enemy hero.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Cataclysm can be useful to locate enemy heroes in the late game, similar to how a Zeus would casually
				use Thundergod's Wrath for vision. This is highly relevant if you suspect the enemy team has Smoked.</li>
			<li>Learn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos
				Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Despite its appearance, Agh's Shard EMP is not classified as traditional "forced movement," but rather a "pull."
				This means it can't interrupt things Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge of Darkness,
				or a Techies Blast Off.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's
				building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been
				going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.</li>
			<li>Try to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game,
				rather than after.</li>
			<li>Heals from items like Greaves, Mek, or Magic Wand are applied before Tornado damage takes place allowing you
				to survive potentially lethal Tornadoes. Casting Pipe's barrier may allow you to Blink out of a low-level Tornado when you land.</li>
			<li>Forged Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to
				be annoying. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for any follow up right clicks.</li>
			<li>Remember that Sun Strike damage is split evenly among all targets hit. If you think an ally is about to die to Sun Strike,
				stand next to them to diffuse the damage.
				<ul><li>This is especially relevant in the mid lane. If Invoker is trying to kill your range creep with Sun Strike,
					it's usually worth tanking some damage so he doesn't get the last hit.</li></ul>
			<li>For the love of everything, please bring some sort of detection (Dust or sentry wards) when trying to gank Invoker. Ghost Walk is
				<i>not</i> a good escape, dude needs several points in Wex just to not slow himself.</li>
			<li>Faceless Void's Time Dilation will calculate its debuff for all of Invoker's spells that are on cooldown, even if they aren't
				actively invoked.</li>
		</ul>
