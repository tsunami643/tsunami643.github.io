		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Grave Chill any non-allied unit. If you see the enemy coming to gank you, just Chill
				the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you and your Familiars are trying to catch up to an enemy,
				Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.</li>
			<li>Familiars need to be within 1200 range of your hero to benefit from the Grave Chill cast and Gravekeeper's
				Cloak bonuses.</li>
			<li>When leveling up your Familiars, they have to be re-summoned to get the new stats. Existing Familiars won't
				dynamically update.</li>
			<li>Resummoning Familiars automatically refreshes their Stone Form cooldowns.</li>
			<li>There are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and
				Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, snipe some quick tower damage if
				your lane creeps have disabled backdoor protection, or put them behind a lane and use them to
				distract the next creep wave before a dive.</li>
			<li>Most supports have a tough time dealing with your Familiars, so in teamfights you can try sending them straight on the
				squishiest enemy to quickly force them out of a fight rather than immediately converging on the enemy carry.</li>
			<li>Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor, like Medallion.</li>
			<li>If you and/or your Familiars are taunted (like from Berserker's Call or Winter's Curse), you can force them
				to drop by casting Stone Form from your hero.</li>
			<li>It's often worthwhile to keep a ward on the cliff between the enemy's secret shop and fountain. If you spot
				the courier making its way over, you can try sending your Familiars to snipe it while it's shopping.</li>
			<li>The Familiars can attack Roshan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8lsm62/you_can_kill_roshan_with_visage_birds_at_level_6/">
				without getting attacked back.</a> This is pretty useless since it takes like 5 minutes to kill Rosh, but it is
				amusing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't see the countdown, but you can select a Familiar and see how much time is left on the Stone Form buff
				timer.</li>
			<li>Familiars have terrible vision. It's usually safe to assume they have no idea where you are when there aren't any enemy
				heroes around to be their eyes.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Scan will turn red on Familiars (and all other creep-heroes).</li>
			<li>Crimson Guard is an all-purpose-stop-touching-me-Visage item since damage block works on Familiars.
				Even a Stout Shield can be surprisingly effective at mitigating damage from low level Familiars.
			</li>
