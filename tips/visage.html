		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Grave Chill any non-allied unit. If you see the enemy coming to gank you, just Chill
				the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you and your Familiars are trying to catch up to an enemy,
				Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.</li>
			<li>Familiars need to be within 900 range of your hero to benefit from the Grave Chill cast and Gravekeeper's Cloak bonuses.</li>
			<li>When leveling up your Familiars, they have to be re-summoned to get the new stats. Existing Familiars won't
				dynamically update.</li>
			<li>Resummoning Familiars automatically refreshes their Stone Form cooldowns.</li>
			<li>Casting Stone Form from your hero won't give Magic Stick charges to enemies, but casting it from a Familiar does.</li>
			<li>There are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and
				Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, snipe some quick tower damage if
				your lane creeps have disabled backdoor protection, or put them behind a lane and use them to
				distract the next creep wave before a dive.</li>
			<li>Most supports have a tough time dealing with your Familiars, so in team fights you can try sending them straight on the
				squishiest enemy to quickly force them out of a fight rather than immediately converging on the enemy carry.</li>
			<li>Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor, like from Medallion.</li>
			<li>It's often worthwhile to keep a ward on the cliff between the enemy's secret shop and fountain. If you spot
				an enemy courier making its way over, you can try sending your Familiars to snipe it while it's shopping.</li>
			<li>You can try hiding your Familiars near the back of the Rosh pit to get vision whenever Rosh respawns or to keep
				track of how quickly an enemy is killing Rosh.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't see the countdown, but you can select a Familiar and see how much time is left on the Stone Form buff
				timer.</li>
			<li>Familiars have terrible vision. It's usually safe to assume they have no idea where you are when there aren't any enemy
				heroes around to be their eyes.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Scan will turn red on Familiars (and all other creep-heroes).</li>
			<li>Crimson Guard is an all-purpose-stop-touching-me-Visage item since damage block works on Familiars.
			</li>
			<li>Brewmaster's Storm Brewling can deal significant damage to Familiars with Dispel Magic. Try burn off Visage's
				Gravekeeper's Cloak magic resistance stacks with the Fire Brewling first.</li>
			<li>Winter Wyvern can be irritating for Visage to deal with. Cold Embrace nullifies all damage from your Familiars and if you're
				caught off guard, getting Winter's Cursed next to your Familiars could be fatal.</li>
