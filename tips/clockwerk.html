		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>When using Battery Assault in lane, position yourself so that the enemy creeps won't absorb hits. Stand
				along the outer perimeter of an enemy hero, rather than bulldozing through the middle of the creep wave.</li>
			<li>Avoid immediately right clicking the enemy hero and drawing creep aggro when you're going in with
				Battery Assault in lane.</li>
			<li>Ideally, you want to kill the corner Cogs when you're trying to break out. Enemies will occasionally
				shock themselves twice if they take your route out.</li>
			<li>Using Cogs as an area denial tool is just as useful as locking someone in. Use it to prevent enemies
				from chasing you or during high ground tower defenses.</li>
			<li>If you're offlaning, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2m7s9IHytg">consider using Cogs to block
				your lane creeps' pathing</a> to slow them down and make the waves meet closer to your tower. You can
				also lock the creeps in as soon as they spawn on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRDi7eX1qTg">Radiant</a>
				or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEMSoVUghA4">Dire.</a></li>
			<li>Rocket Flares give vision on detonation, we all know that, but the vision provided during the Flare's
				flight is just as important. Make a decision whether you want vision of a small area for a long time or
				a large area for a short time. If you are policing the Rosh pit, detonate the Flare there. If you're
				trying to get information about where the enemies are during a lull, let it fly all over their jungle
				and explode somewhere useless. Ideally you can do both in one flare and get a double kill where it
				explodes, but that's not always going to happen.</li>
			<li>If you're mid and wardless, use Rocket Flare to get vision of a rune spot.</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2flle0/thanks_to_admiral_bulldogs_urging_in_his_ama_i/">Supposedly
				the 'projectile' used for Rocket Flare can block jungle camps.</a>
				Does anyone ever use this? No. Will people harass me if I don't include this information? Yes.</li>
			<li>You can Hookshot to allied units or neutrals or Rosh. Keep this in mind if Hook is off cooldown and
				you're getting ganked.</li>
			<li>Hookshot stuns through spell immunity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Battery Assault can't hit invis units but Cogs can. So if you're playing Sand King and you think you're
				safe in your Sandstorm, be aware that the shock on Cogs can hit you.</li>
			<li>Rattletrap: Professional Clarity Assassin. Try to keep clarity/salve usage on the down low, even if
				Clock's not in your lane. That dude will Flare you at the worst possible times.</li>
			<li>Rocket Flare is a popular spell to get cross-map kills. If you're low on HP and Clock is far away, pause
				for a moment once you're in fog to try to evade a flare.</li>
			<li>Hookshots are fairly easy to juke if you know they're coming. If you're trying to escape and you just
				walked into a flare, stand still for a moment or change your current path trajectory.</li>
