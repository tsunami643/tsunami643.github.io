		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The Stroke of Fate projectile actually does shoot out at a slight angle, as the visual suggests.
				It always starts 120 range to your left, so if you're trying to hit someone close quarters, target
				accordingly.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Stroke projectile provides a small radius of vision as it travels and where it ends.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you cast Stroke of Fate on your hero's portrait when your hero isn't moving, the projectile will
				always shoot out 90Â° to your right, but the animation will look like you're shooting it straight. Not really
				practical, but very annoying for enemies to predict.
			</li>
			<li>
				Phantom's Embrace pops Linken's Sphere on cast, not on projectile impact.
			</li>
			<li>
				Casting Phantom's Embrace on a siege creep will make it immediately lose interest in the tower it's attacking
				and start catapulting the Phantom instead.
			</li>
			<li>
				Even though enemies can't disjoint Phantom's Embrace, for some reason Grimstroke can disjoint it himself
				when it's returning. So be sure to retrieve your wife before you Blink if she's flying back, otherwise
				the cooldown won't refresh.
			</li>
			<li>
				When entering a Chronosphere the Phantom's Embrace projectile will pause if it's traveling to a target.
				If it's latched on to someone inside of a Chronosphere, it automatically flies back and applies the nuke damage.
				Thus, if you catch an enemy facing into a Chrono, but still on the edge where the Phantom can latch it, you can
				spam the spell on them.
			</li>
			<li>When Phantom's Embrace is cast on targets affected by Soulbind, be aware that only the primary Embrace returning will refresh the cooldown. So cast
				it on the enemy who's less likely to kill the ghost.</li>
			<li>Phantom's Embrace refreshes its cooldown in two ways. Once if an enemy target dies with the Ghost on them and once when the Ghost
				returns to your hero. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/otnbyl/grimstroke_abuse_tip_phantom_embrace_refreshes/">You can somewhat exploit this by casting Embrace on a dying creep, casting Embrace on another target
				once the creep death refreshes the cooldown, and then casting another Embrace when the Ghost returns to your hero.</a>
			</li>
			<li>Phantom's Embrace provides shared vision over the target once the projectile lands.</li>
			<li>
				The more heroes being damaged by Ink Swell's tendrils, the faster it reaches the maximum stun duration.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ink Swell can be cast on allied creeps and summons. This also includes allied couriers, so you can actually send an Ink Swelled 
				courier in to potentially stun a target from out of nowhere.
			</li>
			<li>
				Enemies won't see any visual of the tendrils damaging them if the Ink Swelled target is invisible.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ink Swell works fully on banished allies, however none of the particle effects will be visible.
			</li>
			<li>
				Soulbind's leash can cancel TPs, even through spell immunity, but only if the target is actually bound to something else.
				No bind, no leash, no TP cancel.
			</li>
			<li>
				Soulbind provides shared vision for all targets that are affected, even if a hero is solo Soulbound.
			</li>
			<li>
				Soulbind can target and connect to creep-heroes, like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage Familiars, and Warlock's Golem.
			</li>
			<li>
				Soulbind cannot link a primary target to illusions or invisible heroes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Linken's Sphere can block Soulbind for the primary target, but Lotus Orb has no effect on Soulbind. Cast it on a Lotus'd
				target without fear of it being reflected.
			</li>
			<li>
				Soulbind is a wacky spell. Mechanically, think of it like you're putting a Lotus Orb on an enemy, except anything that
				would get reflected will actually be cast again targeting the other bound hero. That being said, here are the answers to a few
				burning questions you may have always wanted the answer to:
				<ul>
					<li>Axe's Culling Blade will only give your cooldown back if the primary target is successfully Culled.</li>
					<li>Chaos Knight's Reality Rift will suck both targets in towards you.</li>
					<li>Kunkka's X will connect on both heroes, but casting the Return will only bring back the primary target.</li>
					<li>Huskar will Life Break to the primary target, then immediately to the secondary target after connecting.</li>
					<li>Legion Commander will quite literally 2v1 in a Duel. You'll get Duel damage for each target that dies. If you die,
						they'll both get damage. If the primary target dies, you'll move on to the secondary target for however much time is left.
						I have absolutely no clue how the primary target is chosen, I can't find any logic to it.</li>
					<li>Nature's Prophet's Wrath of Nature will only double up if you directly cast it on one of the targets, not if you
						ground target it.</li>
					<li>Oracle will start channeling another Fortune's End after the first one connects, but you won't see the channel bar on your HUD
						and you need to be standing still before the second channel starts.</li>
					<li>Phantom Assassin will end up on the primary target with Phantom Strike. She will also shoot out six Daggers with
						her "Triple Strike Stifling Dagger" talent.</li>
					<li>Riki's Blink Strike will damage both heroes, but he'll end up on the primary target.</li>
					<li>Sand King will Burrowstrike and end up at the targeted location, but a second Burrowstrike will be cast from SK's
						starting point in the direction of the secondary target. If the secondary target is out of range, the stun
						won't connect. If the primary target is along the same angle, they can get hit twice.</li>
					<li>Yes, with Skywrath's "+1  Arcane Bolt Per Cast" talent and Agh's Scepter, he can shoot <i>six</i> Arcane Bolts in a single cast.</li>
					<li>Sniper will target the primary hero with Assassinate and then immediately shoot another projectile at the secondary target
						once the first connects.</li>
					<li>Tiny's Toss doesn't do anything when you're throwing a Soulbound target, but if you Toss something <i>at</i> a bound target,
						you will attempt another Toss targeting the secondary hero once your first Toss lands. So if you Toss a Soulbound hero on itself,
						they'll fly up in the air and if you keep standing there, you'll Toss them to the secondary target as soon as they land.</li>
					<li>Tusk's Snowball and Walrus Punch only target the primary hero.</li>
					<li>Terrorblade will Sunder the primary target's HP, the primary gets the secondary's HP, and the secondary will get TB's HP.</li>
					<li>Vengeful Spirit will Nether Swap to the primary target's location, the primary will move to the secondary, and the secondary will
						move to Venge.</li>
					<li>Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse will work on both enemies and their allies will attack whichever hero is closest to them.
						However, if both Cursed targets are within the AoE of each other's Curse, neither of them will take any damage.</li>
					<li>Channeled spells like Bane's Fiend's Grip and Shadow Shaman's Shackles work as expected. You stay still, both enemies get affected.</li>
					<li>Only the primary hero gets targeted by Jugg's Omnislash, Morph's Morph, Rubick's Spell Steal, Spirit Breaker's Charge,
						and Windranger's Focus Fire. Also, Visage's Soul Assumption doesn't duplicate for some reason, it only hits the primary target.
					</li>
					<li>Only the secondary hero gets targeted by Spirit Breaker's Nether Strike.</li>
					<li>The succ spells (Lion's Mana Drain, Pugna's Life Drain, Death Prophet's Spirit Siphon, Razor's Static Link) will work on both targets simultaneously.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait illusions are spell immune.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>There is a way to get two Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait illusions of the same hero, but the procedure is a little
				convoluted. You need to target Soulbind on an <i>illusion</i> of a hero and link it to their real hero. Then you need to cast Dark Portrait on the
				<i>real hero.</i> If you do this in any other order, you won't get two Dark Portraits.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You can kill the Phantom's Embrace projectile while it's flying towards its target.
			</li>
			<li>For some reason, the Phantom's Embrace projectile can't pass through Disruptor's Kinetic Field.</li>
			<li>
				The Phantom can't be dispelled, but will instantly die if you go invis, spell immune,
				or become invulnerable (like from a banish, Manta Style activation, or Bane Nightmare).
			</li>
			<li>Remember that Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace cooldown will be refreshed if you don't kill the ghost.</li>
			<li>Phantom's Embrace always has the highest priority for auto-attacking. Just attack+move to get it off if it's
				too hard to right click its hitbox.</li>
			<li>
				The Ink Swell buff can be dispelled off enemies, but it'll still stun and damage the area once purged.
			</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If you attempt to dispel the Agh's Shard Ink Swell off an enemy with a Eul's Cyclone,
				you'll end the Swell, but the hard dispel of the Agh's Shard will immediately cancel the Cyclone.</li>
			<li>
				However, killing the Ink Swelled target will prevent the stun and damage from going off.
			</li>
			<li>
				You only count as leashed if Soulbind is actually binding you to someone else. If not, you can use
				movement spells and TPs freely.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are no reliable ways of breaking the Soulbind leash, so please cooperate with your chained ally
				to move around instead of comically stretching the bind in opposite directions. Think of it like one
				of those races where both of you have one leg tied together, except your teammate is actually
				a cat who's freaking out and wants nothing to do with this.
			</li>
			<ul><li>Okay, I lied. There are a <i>few</i> reliable ways of breaking Soulbind. Earth Spirit can Boulder Smash people out,
				Huskar can just Life Break out of it, and Tiny can just Toss homies out of the break range.</li>
				<li>You can also use the movement during a self-cast Wind Waker to break out of the leash.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you're a carry and Grimstroke has made a Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait of you,
				focus it. It deals more damage than you, but it also dies very quickly. Don't get lazy,
				kill it immediately.</li>
