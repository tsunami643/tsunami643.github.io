		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Burning Barrage arrows briefly provide flying vision over their projectiles. You can use this to help an ally get vision of a cliff
				for dewarding.
			</li>
			<li>Manually casting Searing Arrows on an enemy hero will not draw aggro from creeps.</li>
			<li>Searing Arrows affects structures.</li>
			<li>Similar to most other invis skills, Skeleton Walk has a very obvious cast animation (even if you cast it
				while invis). If you're hunting someone, run into the fog to refresh it if needed. Otherwise, your target
				will see a puff of fire right next to them and bail.</li>
			<li>Also, like other invis skills, you can cast Skeleton Walk while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>However, <i>unlike</i> most other invis skills, Clinkz can cast Death Pact during Skeleton Walk and it <i>won't</i>
				end the invisibility.</li>
			<li>Try to time your ganks so that if things go wrong, Skeleton Walk is off cooldown.</li>
			<li>You can check the <a title="Doom" href="/?Doom">Doom page</a> for a list of useful creep abilities to use with the "Death Pact Gains Creep Abilities" talent.
				Bear in mind that you only get the <i>first</i> ability a creep has, not all the abilities.</li>
				<ul><li>Clinkz specifically benefits from a few other creep spells as well. The orange Ogre Bruiser's stun has a long windup
					animation, but you can cast it while in Skeleton Walk and it won't break your invisibility until the spell goes off.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Chen/Enchantress/Dominated allied Hellbears are especially nice to eat since they'll give you their death aura when you Pact them.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Skeleton Archers always spawn directly to the left and right of wherever your hero is facing. You can try to
				strategically spawn skellies on cliffs to take advantage of their 800 day/night vision.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span><span class="shard"></span>Burning Army attack damage changes dynamically to match a percentage Clinkz's own right click damage.
				The skeletons benefit from attack range buffs, Searing Arrows damage, and the "Searing Arrows Multishot" talent. Their attacks do not apply any item modifiers
				that your hero has.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span><span class="shard"></span>You can cast Death Pact on your Burning Army skeletons. They have more HP than most jungle creeps,
				so they're almost always the best thing to Pact.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span><span class="shard"></span>Burning Army skeletons only attack heroes and can't attack any other type of unit.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dust is somewhat useful against Clinkz, but sentries are much better. Clinkz gets bonus move speed
				when he's Skelly Walkin', which makes him hard to catch with or without detection. The goal is to catch
				him off guard and take the offensive.</li>
			<li>Consider keeping your own sentries if you're a carry and Clinkz is starting to roam. You can't depend on
				your supports to follow you around constantly with detection.</li>
			<li>Get a Ghost Scepter if you're a support. It will save your life versus this spooky archer.</li>
			<li>It only takes two hero attacks to kill each Burning Army skeleton.</li>
			<li>Damage block does <i>not</i> mitigate damage from Burning Army skeletons since the skeletons are
				classified as ward-type units and damage block doesn't work on wards.</li>
			<li>A ground targeted Gleipnir can catch and reveal an enemy Clinkz.</li>
