		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Tar Bomb can be cast on buildings.</li>
			<li>You can cast Death Pact on your Skeleton Archers.</li>
			<li>You can cast Death Pact on creeps protected by Glyph or Roshan's banner.</li>
			<li>For some reason you can Death Pact wards you own. Consider keeping a sentry ward in your inventory for a quick snack if you desperately need access to HP.</li>
			<li>Chen/Enchantress/Dominated allied Hellbears are especially nice to Death Pact in a team fight since they'll give their death aura when you eat them.</li>
			<li>Skeleton Archers' attacks match the range of Clinkz and the damage changes dynamically to match a percentage Clinkz's own right click damage.</li>
			<li>Skeleton Archers benefit from Tar Bomb, but their attacks do not apply any other attack modifiers that your hero has.
				<ul><li><span class="talent"></span>Skeleton Archers benefit from the "Tar Bomb Multishot" talent.</li></ul>
			<li>Skeleton Archers always spawn directly to the left and right of wherever your hero is facing when you exit Skeleton Walk. You can try to strategically spawn
				skellies on cliffs to take advantage of their 800 day/night vision.</li>
			<li>Similar to most other invis skills, you can cast Skeleton Walk while channeling, like during a TP.
				<ul><li>However, <i>unlike</i> most other invis skills, Clinkz can cast Strafe and Death Pact during Skeleton Walk and it <i>won't</i>
				end the invisibility.</li></ul>
			<li>Try to time your ganks so that if things go wrong, Skeleton Walk is already off cooldown.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Burning Barrage arrows briefly provide flying vision over their projectiles. You can use this to help get vision of a cliff
				for dewarding.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Burning Barrage arrows have true strike, apply all attack modifiers, and deal damage even if your hero is disarmed.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The Strafe buff can be dispelled off Clinkz, but his Skeleton Archers will still keep the buff.</li>
			<li>Dust is somewhat useful against Clinkz, but sentry wards are much better. Clinkz gets bonus move speed
				when he's Skelly Walkin', which makes him hard to catch with or without detection. The goal is to catch
				him off guard and take the offensive.</li>
			<li>Consider keeping your own sentries if you're a carry and Clinkz is starting to roam. You can't depend on
				your supports to follow you around constantly with detection.</li>
			<li>A ground targeted Gleipnir can catch and reveal invisible enemies.</li>
			<li>Get a Ghost Scepter if you're a support. It will save your life versus this spooky archer.</li>
			<li>Damage block does <i>not</i> mitigate damage from Skeleton Archers since the Skeletons are
				classified as ward-type units and damage block doesn't work on wards.</li>
			<li>Nyx Assassin's Nyxth Sense innate gives him true sight of invisible enemies near his hero which may catch you unawares while
				you're Skeleton Walking.</li>
