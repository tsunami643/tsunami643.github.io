		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't just toss Napalms casually. Go out of your way to make sure you're keeping stacks up on the enemy
				hero. The difference between 2 stacks and 4 stacks can be the difference between suggesting the enemy
				eat a Tango or go back to the fountain.</li>
			<li>Enemies only get Magic Stick charges if you're in vision when the spell is cast. Try to cast Napalm from
				fog as often as possible.</li>
			<li>Sticky Napalm gives flying vision around its cast point. Keep this in mind if you
				need to check the Rosh pit, high grounds, or are trying to find a juking enemy.</li>
			<li>Sticky Napalm deals half damage to ancient creeps.</li>
			<li>You can click on an enemy hero to see how many Magic Stick/Wand charges they have. If they're sitting on
				10, it's probably a bad idea to go for a kill.</li>
			<li>Napalm is relevant all game long because turn speed is relevant all game long. Just because you're not
				laning anymore doesn't mean you should stop using the spell. It still gives vision, it still raises your
				damage, and enemies will still find it annoying as hell to turn in molasses.</li>
			<li>Sticky Napalm has rules against proccing on most item DoTs from Batrider (no Radiance, Urn/Vessel, or Orb of Venom/Corrosion),
				but Meteor Hammer does benefit from Sticky Napalm damage.</li>
			<li>Firefly gives Batrider unobstructed movement, but does not turn him into a flying unit. As a result, you cannot fly over Mars's
				Arena walls.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the buff icon timer for Firefly. When it ends you need to make sure you won't be stuck
				somewhere you don't want to be.</li>
			<li>Enemies can see your Firefly trail even when you're under Smoke.</li>
			<li>Even if you die, your Firefly trail will remain for its full duration.</li>
			<li>Don't feel obligated to drag someone as far as you can when you Flaming Lasso someone. If your team is
				nearby or you're 1v1ing, your time may be spent better trying to lay on additional Napalm stacks.</li>
			<li>Or if you grabbed the enemy while they were facing away from the direction they'd like to escape, you may
				prefer spending the last second of Lasso placing one Napalm to slow them when they try to turn around.</li>
			<li>If your team applies fears (like Lone Druid's Savage Roar or Dark Willow's Terrorize) or hypnotizes (like Lich's Sinister Gaze or
				Void Spirit's Aether Remnant) on a Lassoed target, they will instantly break the Lasso. Other sources of
				forced movement (like Pudge's Meat Hook or even Eul's) have no movement effect on a Lassoed target.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>With Agh's Scepter Lasso, Linken's Sphere can be bypassed if a target is the secondary Lasso, not the primary Lasso.</li>
			<li>Batrider has 1200 day vision, most heroes have 1800.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Buy a Magic Stick ASAP against this fool.</li>
			<li>Once you get 3-4 stacks of Napalm on you in lane, back off and let the debuff time out. You can check how many
				stacks you have by looking at your current debuffs.</li>
			<li>Activating Phase Boots on melee heroes can improve your turn rate when dealing with Sticky Napalm.</li>
			<li>Kunkka X Marks Returning a Lassoed target will immediately cancel the Lasso.</li>
			<li>Don't hug the nearby tree-line when defending tier two towers. Batriders love hovering hidden over those trees
				to get easy Lassos.</li>
