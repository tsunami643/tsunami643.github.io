		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't just toss Napalms casually. Go out of your way to make sure you're keeping stacks up on the enemy
				hero. The difference between 2 stacks and 4 stacks can be the difference between suggesting the enemy
				eat a tango or go back to the fountain.</li>
			<li>You can click on an enemy hero to see how many Magic Stick/Wand charges they have. If they're sitting on
				10, it's probably a bad idea to go for a kill.</li>
			<li>Napalm is relevant all game long because turn speed is relevant all game long. Just because you're not
				laning anymore doesn't mean you should stop using the spell. It still gives vision, it still raises your
				damage, and it's still annoying as hell to have to turn in bullet time.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the buff icon timer for Firefly. When it ends you need to make sure you won't be stuck
				somewhere you don't want to be.</li>
			<li>Don't feel obligated to drag someone as far as you can when you Flaming Lasso someone. If your team is
				nearby or you're 1v1ing, your time may be spent better trying to lay on additional Napalm stacks.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Buy a Magic Stick ASAP against this fool. You can get one from the side shop.</li>
			<li>Once you get 3-4 stacks of Napalm on you, back off and let the debuff wear off. You can check how many
				stacks you have by looking at your current debuffs.</li>
			<li>Don't hug the nearby tree-line when defending T2 towers. Batriders love hovering over the trees that
				surround T2s to get easy Lassos.</li>
