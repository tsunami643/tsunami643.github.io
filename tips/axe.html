		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy
				hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro. Don't waste mana on Call if you don't
				have to.</li>
			<li>Enemies will follow you around when taunted in Berserker's Call. If you value positioning more than damage, you can walk
				or Force Staff after a Call to shepherd taunted enemies in your direction.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call goes through spell immunity. If you see a BKB'd Shadow Fiend having an epileptic fit
				while he's casting his ult, walk up and Q him.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call's taunt is undispellable, even by strong dispels like Press the Attack or Kraken Shell.</li>
			<li>Just because you don't catch anyone in Berserker's Call doesn't mean the spell was a bust. You get massive
				armor during its duration which can easily make the difference between life and death early game.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call is a handy way to interrupt an enemy's invisibility. If an enemy Clinkz just ran away with
				10 HP, try Blinking into where you think he'll be and cast Call. If you're right, they'll be forced to
				attack you and lose their invis.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger is a great spell for disabling Blink Daggers, especially when breaking high ground.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger is a great spell for annoying supports in lane. Either they have to steal a last hit from their carry
				or they panic over denies and miss them anyway.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger gives Axe a stacking movespeed bonus for <i>every</i> enemy unit affected. This includes creeps and
				neutrals, so cast it on anything in range if you have mana to burn when you're chasing or escaping.</li>
			<li>When jungling a camp with Satyrs, draw aggro back a bit so that the tiny ranged Satyrs aren't getting
				hit by Counter Helix. They give you extra chances to Helix at the cost of practically no damage, but
				they'll usually die first if you keep them in Helix range.</li>
			<li>You can Cull any enemy unit, including creeps. While this is usually irrelevant, it can be worth Culling
				a creep to get the AoE movement speed buff to catch up to or escape from an enemy.</li>
			<li>If you have Agh's, you can Cull a creep to apply the AoE Battle Hunger to all heroes in a 700 radius.</li>
			<li>You can instagib flying or walking couriers at any level of Culling Blade since couriers are always
				below the HP threshold.</li>
			<li>Leave Tranquil Boots in your backpack when farming the jungle and put them back in your inventory before finishing the camp
				so you don't trigger the damage cooldown.</li>
			<li>Axe has one of the highest base HP regen stats in the game. This makes creep cutting a very effective strategy during the
				laning phase if the enemy team doesn't have any heroes who can deal with you from a distance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Battle Hunger can be taken off by denies. If your lane mate is being a hungry hungry hippo with last
				hits, focus your energy on landing a deny.</li>
			<li>When trying to help an ally who is about to die to Axe in lane, <i>don't</i> toss a few measly auto attacks if Axe isn't
				close to death himself. Axe will gladly trade some damage if it means he gets a few more chances to Helix.</li>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, and Troll Warlord's Battle Trance. It can also kill Rosh.
				Culling Blade don't care.</li>
			<li>Eulsing an initiating Axe can help save your allies from being repositioned from Berserker's Call or killing themselves on his Blade Mail.</li>
			<li>If you <i>do</i> manage to steal Axe's Boots (or any hero's item in general), you should store them somewhere safe
				on your side of the map instead of destroying them. A destroyed item won't count towards an enemy's net worth,
				so you can get more gold per kill if you keep an item alive as a trophy.</li>
