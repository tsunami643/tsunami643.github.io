		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy
				hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro. Don't waste mana on Berserker's Call if you don't
				have to.</li>
			<li>Enemies will follow you around when taunted in Berserker's Call. If you value positioning more than damage, you can walk
				or Force Staff after a Call to shepherd taunted enemies in your direction.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call goes through spell immunity. If you see a BKB'd Shadow Fiend having an epileptic fit
				while he's casting his ult, walk up and Q him.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call's taunt is undispellable, even by strong dispels like Legion Commander's Press the Attack or Tidehunter's Kraken Shell.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call is a handy way to interrupt an enemy's invisibility. If an enemy Clinkz just ran away with
				10 HP, try Blinking into where you think he'll be and cast Call. If you're right, they'll be forced to
				attack you and lose their invis.</li>
			<li>Just because you don't catch anyone in Berserker's Call doesn't mean the spell was a bust. You get massive
				armor during its duration which can sometimes make the difference between life and death.</li>
			<li>Remember that Battle Hunger DPS scales off your armor. So if an enemy is close to death from Battle Hunger,
				try casting a Berserker's Call on nothing just to give yourself more armor.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger is a great spell for disabling Blink Daggers, especially when breaking high ground.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger is a great spell for annoying supports in lane. Either they have to steal a last hit from their carry
				or they panic over denies and miss them anyway.</li>
			<li>When jungling a camp with Satyrs, draw aggro back a bit so that the tiny ranged Satyrs aren't getting
				hit by Counter Helix. They give you extra chances to Helix at the cost of practically no damage, but
				they'll usually die first if you keep them in Helix range.</li>
			<li>When jungling a camp with Hill Trolls, focus your right clicks on the shield Trolls because they Break you and prevent you from
				getting Counter Helix procs.</li>
			<li>You can Cull any enemy unit, including creeps. While this is usually irrelevant, it can be worth Culling
				a creep to get the AoE movement speed buff to catch up to or escape from an enemy.</li>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, and Troll Warlord's Battle Trance. It can also kill Rosh.
				Culling Blade don't care.</li>				
			<li>You can instagib flying or walking couriers at any level of Culling Blade since couriers are always
				below the HP threshold.</li>
			<li>You get permanent Culling Blade stacks off of Aegis kills or Wraith King Reincarnation kills.</li>
			<li>Axe has one of the highest base HP regen stats in the game. This makes creep cutting a very effective strategy during the
				laning phase if the enemy team doesn't have any heroes who can deal with you from a distance.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Spell immune enemies caught with an Agh's Scepter Berserker's Call will get a Battle Hunger
				debuff applied to them. It won't deal any damage, but it will slow them through spell immunity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Battle Hunger can be taken off by denies. If your lane mate is being a hungry hungry hippo with last
				hits, focus your energy on landing a deny.</li>
			<li>When trying to help an ally who is about to die to Axe in lane, <i>don't</i> toss a few measly auto attacks if Axe isn't
				close to death himself. Axe will gladly trade some damage if it means he gets a few more chances to Helix.</li>
			<li>Eulsing an initiating Axe can help save your allies from being repositioned from Berserker's Call or killing themselves on his Blade Mail.</li>
			<li>If you somehow manage to steal Axe's Boots (or any hero's item in general), you should store them somewhere safe
				on your side of the map instead of destroying them. A destroyed item or a stolen item in your inventory won't count
				towards an enemy's net worth, but an item on the ground does. This means you'll get more gold per kill, they'll lose more
				gold per death, and their buyback will cost more since the grounded item is still factored into their net worth.</li>
