		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane.
				Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each
				level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.</li>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for allied units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Please get at least one level in Blur early. Pretty please. If not for the evasion, get it for detection
				purposes. Blur triggers on invisible and fogged heroes that are in a 1600 radius around from you. If you
				suddenly become de-Blurred, a hero is likely coming to gank you.</li>
			<li>You can also use this to scout enemies when roaming around the map or when checking the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Coup de Grâce makes it incredibly frustrating to grab CS while pushing, so take down the creeps that are
				being focused the least when the waves clash (ranged creep first, then that one melee creep that was
				late to the party, then that's about it).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A Magic Stick may be a good investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to
				spam Dagger.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, get a MKB. If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter. If you're tanky, get a Blade
				Mail.</li>
			<li>Silver Edge can Break her evasion and her crit.</li>
			<li>A BKB also makes it very difficult for PA to start dealing damage to you since she can't slow you down
				with Dagger or target you to get her boosted attack speed with Phantom Strike.</li>
			<li>The minimap will not help you against PA. Many times you'll be farming your lane and you'll see a mass
				of creeps hanging out at one of your towers on the map and you'll think, "Eh, no one's there, the tower
				will push it back." Then all of a sudden PA is knocking on your tier 2. Actually pan around the map to
				verify if PA is truly off the map or not.</li>
