		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane.
				Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each
				level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.</li>
			<li>If an enemy in your lane has a Magic Stick, cast your Stifling Daggers from fog whenever possible. Stick only gains charges
				from spells that are cast in vision.</li>
			<li>Stifling Dagger applies damage as an <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Attack_Damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attack</a>.
				This is a unique attack type that ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers. If you have an attack modifier with a proc,
				it'll roll for a chance once the projectile lands.
				<ul><li>Since Stifling Dagger is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke once it damages a unit.</li>
				<li>You can activate Shadow Blade/Silver Edge after the Dagger projectile is launched to get the backstab damage.</li></ul>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>When pushing an uncontested tower, you can Phantom Strike onto a nearby enemy creep and use the attack speed buff to siege
				the tower.</li>
			<li>When farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Phantom Strike onto rather than walking
				around from camp to camp.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>With the "Veiled One" facet, lane creeps and neutrals don't react to getting attacked by you when Blur is active.</li>
			<li>You're not really 'invisible' under Blur's active. Enemies won't see your icon on their minimap and you will be considered untargetable by single
				target spells, but enemies will still see a cloaked version of your model wherever you are.</li>
			<li>Activating Blur disjoints any incoming projectiles.</li>
			<li>Blur's active dispelling follows the same rules as Smoke, but with a smaller radius. Meaning, it will dispel when near enemy buildings (including Outposts)
				and heroes.
				<ul><li>For some reason, Blur also dispels when moving near enemy Watchers too.</li></ul>
			<li>Reflected Blade Mail damage doesn't go through debuff immunity. If you're killing yourself on enemy Blade Mails, consider buying a BKB.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Fan of Knives absolutely shreds illusions because the damage calculates off of a target's max HP.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Fan of Knives will also be reset if you have an Agh's Scepter on Phantom Assassin.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span></span>Agh's Scepter refreshing cooldowns on kills even works on Aegis deaths/Wraith King Reincarnation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A Magic Stick may be a smart investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to
				spam Dagger for last hits.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, get a MKB or Bloodthorn for the accuracy to hit her through the evasion provided by her Immaterial innate.</li>
			<li>Attacks proccing Chain Lightning from Maelstrom/Mjollnir/Gleipnir cannot be evaded. Not a huge bump in accuracy, but it's something.</li>
			<li>If you are a Chen (with Agh's Shard Holy Persuasion) or Doom (with "Doom Devours Ancients" talent) or built a Helm of the Overlord,
				consider getting a blue Thunderhide lizard for the accuracy aura.</li>
			<li>If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter or Aeon Disk for survivability. A Pavise could allow you or an ally to survive a few more right clicks
				with the barrier. If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail so she'll kill herself on you.</li>
			<li>Silver Edge and other sources of <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Break#Sources">Break</a> (like from Viper's Viper Strike)
				can disable the evasion she gets from her Immaterial innate as well as Coup de Grace's Deadly Focus crit.</li>
			<li>PA cannot Phantom Strike when rooted.</li>
			<li>You can dispel Phantom Strike attack speed off of PA. This can make heroes like Shadow Demon with Demonic Purge or items like Nullifier
				handy counters.</li>
			<li>The minimap is very deceptive when playing against a PA. You can never be 100% sure of her whereabouts because Blur's active
				hides her from your minimap.</li>
			<li>Bloodseeker can be pretty difficult for PA to deal with since she needs to move around a lot during fights and Rupture
				really harshes her vibe.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>The Agh's Shard Fan of Knives break debuff can be removed with basic dispels.</li>
