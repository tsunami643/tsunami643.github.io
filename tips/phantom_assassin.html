		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane.
				Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each
				level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.</li>
			<li>If an enemy in your lane has a Magic Stick, cast your Daggers from fog whenever possible. Stick only gains charges
				from spells that are cast in vision.</li>
			<li>Stifling Dagger applies whatever on-hit effects your hero has like Orb of Venom or Basher. If you go invis from
				Shadow Blade/Silver Edge while the Dagger is traveling, it'll deal the Shadow Walk bonus damage on impact.</li>
			<li>Since Stifling Dagger applies a 'right click' on a target, casting it will break your Smoke when the projectile lands.</li>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Attacking creeps or neutrals won't dispel an active Blur and neutrals won't even react to getting right clicked by you.</li>
			<li>You can activate Blur even within the detection radius of enemies if you need a "fade time's" worth of invisibility.
				Meaning, you can activate Blur, be vanished for 0.75s, and use that time to disjoint projectiles.</li>
			<li>Blur follows the same rules as Smoke, but with a smaller radius. Meaning, it will dispel when near buildings and heroes.</li>
			<li>Coup de Grâce makes it incredibly frustrating to get last hits while pushing, so take down the creeps that are
				being focused the least when the waves clash (ranged creep first, then that one melee creep that was
				late to the party, then that's about it).</li>
			<li>Reflected Blade Mail damage doesn't go through spell immunity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A Magic Stick may be a smart investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to
				spam Dagger for last hits.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, get a MKB or Bloodthorn so you can hit her. If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter or Aeon Disk for survivability.
				If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail so she'll kill herself.</li>
			<li>Silver Edge and other sources of <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Break">Break</a> (like from Viper's Nethertoxin or Nyx's Vendetta)
				can disable Blur's evasion and Coup de Grâce's crit.</li>
			<li>Chain Lightning procs from Maelstrom or Mjollnir cannot be evaded, giving you a stealth 25% accuracy item.</li>
			<li>Divine Rapier gives true strike (100% accuracy).</li>
			<li>PA cannot Phantom Strike when rooted.</li>
			<li>The minimap is very deceptive when playing against a PA. You can never be 100% sure of her whereabouts because of Blur,
				so always be cautious if you don't see her icon on the minimap.</li>
