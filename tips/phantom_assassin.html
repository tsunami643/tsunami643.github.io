		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the ins and outs of the Stifling Dagger are critical to not getting demolished in lane.
				Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each
				level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.</li>
			<li>If an enemy in your lane has a Magic Stick, cast your Daggers from fog whenever possible. Stick only gains charges
				from spells that are cast in vision.</li>
			<li>Stifling Dagger applies whatever on-hit effects your hero has like Orb of Venom or Basher. If you go invis from
				Shadow Blade/Silver Edge while the Dagger is traveling, it'll deal the Shadow Walk bonus damage on impact.</li>
			<li>Since Stifling Dagger applies a 'right click' on a target, casting it will break your Smoke when the projectile lands.</li>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>When pushing an uncontested tower, you can Phantom Strike onto a nearby enemy creep and use the attack speed buff to siege
				the tower.</li>
			<li>Lane creeps and neutrals don't react to getting right clicked by you when Blur is active.</li>
			<li>You can activate Blur even within the detection radius of enemies if you need a "fade time's" worth of invisibility.
				Meaning, you can activate Blur, be vanished for a very brief period, and use that time to disjoint projectiles or juke enemies.</li>
			<li>Blur follows the same rules as Smoke, but with a smaller radius. Meaning, it will dispel when near buildings and heroes.</li>
			<li>Reflected Blade Mail damage doesn't go through spell immunity.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Shard Fan of Knives will also be reset if you have an Agh's Scepter on Phantom Assassin.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A Magic Stick may be a smart investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to
				spam Dagger for last hits.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, get a MKB or Bloodthorn so you can hit her. Or a Divine Rapier if you're feeling especially confident.</li>
			<li>If you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter or Aeon Disk for survivability. If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail so she'll kill herself
				on you.</li>
			<li>Silver Edge and other sources of <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Break">Break</a> (like from Viper's Nethertoxin)
				can disable Blur's evasion and Coup de Grâce's crit.</li>
			<li>Chain Lightning procs from Maelstrom/Mjollnir/Gleipnir cannot be evaded, giving you a stealth accuracy item.</li>
			<li>PA cannot Phantom Strike when rooted.</li>
			<li>The minimap is very deceptive when playing against a PA. You can never be 100% sure of her whereabouts because an active Blur
				hides her from your minimap.</li>
