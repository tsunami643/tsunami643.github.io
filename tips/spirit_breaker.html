		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Take advantage of the proximity Greater Bashes you are gifted while Charging. If you're trying to land a
				stun on a unit that can't be targeted by Charge (if they're cycloned, debuff immune/BKB'd, banished, Linken's Sphere'd, etc) line yourself up so that
				you can cast Charge on a unit behind your intended target so you'll bash them en route.</li>
			<li>Charge is blocked by Linken's Sphere on cast. You can potentially outplay this by Charging a creep near where your
				target is farming and hoping the creeps die so the Charge target will shift to the hero. A substitute Charge will
				not pop Linken's.</li>
			<li>If you see an opportunity to gank another lane, consider TPing to the nearest available structure before casting a cross-country Charge.
				The less time an enemy has to react and reposition, the more successful your ganks will be.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked and you can't take the fight, immediately move your camera over to another
				lane, find a creep or neutral, and Charge it. This is your escape mechanism.
				<ul><li>Maintaining vision over Tormentors gives you an easy guaranteed Charge target if needed.</li></ul>
			<li>You can send your courier to give vision of neutral camps to sneakily Charge around the map.</li>
			<li>In your buffs, there is a portrait of the hero you're Charging. You can alt+click this to announce to your team who you're targeting
				with Charge.</li>
			<li>During Charge, you are granted shared vision around the target. That means fog of war is removed around whatever the enemy hero can see.
				This is especially useful against heroes like Night Stalker who have extra vision in certain situations.</li>
			<li>If you want to throw enemies off your Charge trajectory or slightly stall a Charge, consider backpacking move speed items while
				you're Charging. You'll slow yourself down and enemies may think you canceled the charge.</li>
			<li>You can cast non-targeted items while you're Charging, like Phase Boots, Shadow Blade, Mask of Madness, Smoke of Deceit, BKB, and even
				Power Tread switching.</li>
			<li>You can cast Bulldoze while Charging. Charge applies a Greater Bash on everything you hit and Greater Bash
				deals damage based off your move speed, so activating Bulldoze mid-Charge will boost your damage on contact.</li>
			<li>After your Charge connects on an enemy, you'll usually have enough time to fish for one Greater Bash right click in the stun duration
				before you need to chain into Nether Strike.</li>
			<li>Greater Bash's proc chance utilizes <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Random_Distribution#Definition">pseudo-random distribution (PRD).</a>
				Statistically, about one in every six right clicks should be a Bash with 17%, but PRD encourages a lower likelihood of 'streaks.' If you go
				six right clicks with no Bash, chances are now much higher that your next right click <i>will</i> Bash thanks to PRD.
				Try to exploit this by priming right clicks on jungle or lane creeps before going for a gank.</li>
			<li>Basher/Abyssal passive bashes don't work with Spirit Breaker. The game won't allow you to have another bash besides Greater Bash.</li>
			<li>Greater Bash is essentially a crit dressed up in a scaling bash. Unfortunately, the only way of
				amplifying the 'crit' damage is by building move speed, not damage. The plus side is that you have two
				guaranteed ways of proccing this crit Bash with Charge and Nether Strike.</li>
			<li>You can Nether Strike enemy couriers, but it won't damage them.</li>
			<li>Probably the best Dust carrier and anti-invis hero you could ask for in pubs. Every time Dust is off
				cooldown, Charge that Riki and bash him into next Tuesday.</li>
			<li>Get wards in the enemy jungle. Players will automatically avoid farming in lane once they realize you're
				becoming a threat and will start farming their jungle. Teach them that there is no sanctuary from the
				space cow.</li>
			<li>SB is one of the tankiest level 1 heroes in the game. Take advantage of your chuftiness and don't be afraid
				of getting into fights early on.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Mechanically, Agh's Shard Planar Pocket is like putting a Linken's Sphere buff on all your allies in
				an AoE around you. An enemy unit-targeted spell will do nothing to your ally and will instead get re-cast from the enemy onto you.
				If you're curious about the nuanced quirks and features of this spell, feel free to consult <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Spirit_Breaker#Planar_Pocket">the wiki.</a></li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Planar Pocket will redirect channeled disables like Bane's Fiend's Grip,
				Shadow Shaman's Shackles, or Pudge's Dismember, but you'll only get disabled for a brief moment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ward everywhere. You need to always be keeping tabs on Spirit Breaker: Where does he come from, where
				does he go, who is he ganking, Barathrum Joe.</li>
			<li>Even though most Spirit Breakers will carry Dust, consider getting a Glimmer Cape if he's Charging
				often. Nearly all of SB's damage is magical and needs to be dealt quickly, so the magic damage barrier 
				while Glimmered can soak up a lot of his gank potential.</li>
			<li>Charge can break Linken's from across the map. In Herald scum pubs this makes Linken's a Spirit Breaker counter,
				but in RIAA-certified Double Immortal tier, this makes SB a Linken's counter.</li>
			<li>Remember that SB gets increased status resistance while in Bulldoze. Status resistance affects many things.
				It also doesn't affect a lot of things you may think it does.
				<a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Status_Resistance">Here's the wiki page with all the interactions.</a></li>
			<li>One of the easiest heroes to bait. No SB can resist Charging down a lonely Crystal Maiden quietly farming in lane,
				so take advantage of the mad cow's blood thirst. After a few failed ganks, the map will open up
				substantially when he stops Charging on a whim.
				<ul><li>Remember that while you're Charged, Spirit Breaker reveals the same fog of war that your hero sees.
					So don't just stand next to allies in plain sight if you're baiting him, make sure they're hiding behind trees
					where your hero wouldn't be able to naturally see them.</li></ul>
			<li>SB can't cast Charge or Nether Strike when rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Bulldoze can be removed off Spirit Breaker with basic dispels. This makes Eul's a handy item against him.</li>
			<li>Shadow Demon can be a pretty strong counterpick with banishes to protect allies and Demonic Purge to slow SB and
				remove Bulldoze.</li>
			<li>You can stun/root SB while he's Charging to cancel it. This is useful to know when you're getting Charged, but it's also
				useful when you're ganking SB. Keep a stun in your pocket for when he tries to Charge to another lane to escape.</li>
			<li>Force Staff, Harpoon, and other sources of <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Forced_Movement">forced movement</a> can end Charge prematurely.</li>
			<li>Force Staff (or any other source of forced movement) will instantly remove Greater Bash's stun debuff. If an ally is stunned
				by Spirit Breaker's right click or Nether Strike, you can Force Staff them and they'll immediately be unstunned.
			<ul><li>This tip will <i>not</i> work against Charge, however. Charge has its own built in stun mechanic, only stuns using Greater Bash's debuff
				can be taken off with forced movement.</li></ul>
			<li>You can disable SB while he's in the middle of the cast animation for Nether Strike to interrupt the animation.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Planar Pocket cannot be dispelled. Neither off Spirit Breaker himself nor his allies.</li>
