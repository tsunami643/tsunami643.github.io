		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cast Smoke Screen ahead of enemies, not directly on top of them. Try to predict the enemy's current trajectory so they start out
				on the edge of the cloud and have to walk all the way through it.</li>
			<li>Enemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Smoke Screen). If they've already started
				channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Smoke Screen's makes enemies caught in the AoE untargetable by their teammates. For example, a Dazzle
				wouldn't be able to Shallow Grave a teammate caught in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen. Even debuff immune enemies who are in the Smoke Screen AoE can't
				be targeted by teammates.</li>
			<li>Smoke Screen can be cast during Tricks of the Trade.</li>
			<li>You can Blink Strike to allies as well as enemies.</li>
			<li>Blink Strike's slow works on debuff immune enemies.</li>
			<li>When farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Blink Strike onto
				rather than walking around from camp to camp.</li>
			<li>Tricks of the Trade can hit couriers.</li>
			<li>Tricks of the Trade <i>will</i> work if you're disarmed.</li>
			<li>Tricks of the Trade attacks <i>do not</i> have true strike.</li>
			<li>Tricks of the Trade can be used as a disjoint.</li>
			<li>Neutral items won't drop from creeps if you're in Tricks of the Trade. So if you haven't gotten all your neutral items yet,
				avoid last hitting with Tricks, otherwise the creeps will have a zero percent chance of dropping a neutral item.</li>
			<li>You still have collision when you're in Cloak and Dagger, so don't bump into enemies you're
				stalking.</li>
			<li>If you're prowling around a lane that you think might be sentry warded, try intentionally forcing
				creep aggro while invis by right clicking an enemy hero anywhere on the map. If the creeps aggro you,
				then they can obviously see you.</li>
			<li>It's possible to backstab Rosh constantly. You just need a teammate to path as close as possible to
				Rosh, aggro him out a bit, and then remain as the closest target available to Rosh so he doesn't change
				aggro to you while you're scratching his back.</li>
			<li>The backstab damage from Cloak and Dagger factors your lifesteal, crit, and cleave.</li>
			<li>You can purge off Dust detection (after you walk out of the AoE) with basic dispels, like from Eul's, Guardian Greaves,
				Lotus Orb, or Manta Style.</li>
			<li>Unlike with most other invisibility sources, casting abilities or using items does not break Riki's Cloak
				and Dagger invisibility. Only attacking will reveal Riki.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><i>♪ Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit greedy when you realize that you've got no
				   farm. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit tired of listening to all the 'missing'
				   calls. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit nervous when you're in your jungle
				   without any wards. Turn around. Every now and then you get a little bit scared 'cause now you're
				   standing in a purple cloud. AND I NEED A STUN RIGHT NOW, AND I NEED ONE MORE THAN EVER. ♪</i>
				Rikis hate attacking heroes who decide to hold a staring contest rather than run scared. He is practically
				working with a double damage rune from Cloak and Dagger when your back is turned, so if you think you can last the
				Smoke's duration, turn around and have a chat with him. Most of your attacks will miss, and you're still
				going to be silenced, but if backup is coming, fight him. All of this is assuming that you're not playing
				Bristleback, though.</li>
			<li>Good anti-Riki items as a support include pretty much any mid-game support item. Smoke Screen stops you
				from using spells, not items. Force Staff is the typical pickup, Eul's is good, and Ghost Scepter is
				good.</li>
			<li>Riki holds a strong grudge against both King Bars. BKB and MKB are good carry items against a Riki
				because they both allow you to fight in the Smoke.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Smoke Screen will not allow teammates to target you with spells if you're caught
				in the AoE even if you're debuff immune.</li>
			<li>Practice the buddy system. Riki can't really deal with solo-ganking two heroes at the same time.</li>
			<li>Riki cannot cast Blink Strike or Tricks of the Trade when rooted.</li>
			<li>Keep your Spidey senses on point. If you notice that your hero is doing some peculiar pathing or stutter
				stepping for some reason, Riki's probably following you around, gently licking you.</li>
			<li>When pushing or Roshing, place a sentry ward in/around/behind your team to make sure Riki isn't hiding and waiting for
				a big Smoke Screen opportunity.</li>
			<li>Dust of Appearance slows invis units. Since the only way Riki can force himself to become visible
				is by attacking, Dust is usually a huge pain for him to deal with when escaping.</li>
			<li>A ground targeted Gleipnir can catch and reveal an enemy Riki.</li>
			<li>Breaks reveal and remove Riki's Cloak and Dagger invisibility as well as disabling the backstab multiplier.</li>
