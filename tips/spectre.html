		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectre gets a 1 second grace period of collisionless pathing after walking off a Spectral Dagger trail. So if you
				don't need to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape down a cliff
				or across some trees in the opposite direction.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger gives shared vision on every enemy that get hits by the projectile. This allows you to get
				basic vision on invis enemies.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger can't be reflected by Lotus Orb and completely ignores Linken's Sphere for the primary target.</li>
			<li>Desolate damage never misses. It goes through both blinds and evasion.</li>
			<li>Dispersion reflects damage <i>before</i> reductions. This is what makes items like Vanguard, or Hood, or general
				armor items very effective on Spectre.</li>
			<li>If you have 2 lives (buyback, Aegis) save Haunt for your second one. Dispersion from your first death
				will leave the enemy team low, allowing your Haunts to do clean up work.</li>
			<li>Spectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Haunt allows her to perpetually farm
				lanes or split push since she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.</li>
			<li>You can use Reality multiple times during a Haunt cast.</li>
			<li>You swap positions with each illusion that you Reality to. If a target dies, the corresponding Haunt illusion
				will vanish as well.</li>
			<li>You can potentially outplay this mechanic by Daggering and whittling down an enemy with your hero and then swapping
				their Haunt illusion back in to take the last hit with Desolate damage. That way you can quickly return back to where
				you were farming after killing an enemy without having to TP.</li>
			<li>Since there is no cooldown on Reality, you can spam it in a gank or team fight situation to cause some chaos and
				distract the enemies.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Radiance while TPing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectre might as well be holding a pool noodle as a weapon for the first 15 minutes of the game.
				Spectral Dagger is way too expensive to offensively spam, Desolate nearly irrelevant in lane because
				she's too slow to consistently harass and there are creeps everywhere, and Dispersion's payoff is low
				when her HP pool is mediocre and the damage being dealt isn't high. If you shut her down early, her lack
				of a farming skill to fall back on will gimp the enemy team big time.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger creates a trail on invis units if you took damage from the spell.</li>
			<li>Haunt illusions have free pathing, but can be slowed and stunned. Hexes can instantly kill them as well.</li>
			<li>Whenever she Haunts, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to
				mid game her only Haunt damage is coming from Desolate, so don't let it proc.</li>
			<li>Spec doesn't do much damage to Roshan, she's bad at taking towers, and she has pretty miserable AGI gain
				for a carry. This means that when you lose a team fight, Spec's team won't be able to take too many
				objectives.</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Break#Sources_of_Break">Break mechanic</a> is useful against Spectre to disable her Desolate and Dispersion.</li>
			<li>Spectres generally don't like building BKB or MKB, so magic damage and evasion may prove to be more useful
				against her compared to other carries.</li>
