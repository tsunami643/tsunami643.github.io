		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>When farming neutral camps, kill the smaller creeps first. That way you can proc Desolate innate damage on the big creep.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger gives shared vision on every enemy that get hits by the projectile. This allows you to get
				basic vision (not true sight, just location) on invis enemies.</li>
			<li>If your hero is within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it if you damage the camp, like with Spectral Dagger.
				Any further away and neutrals won't aggro your hero when damaged and just keep sitting in their camp.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger can't be reflected by Lotus Orb and completely ignores Linken's Sphere for the primary target.
				<ul><li>If you unit target Spectral Dagger, only <i>secondary</i> targets in the path's way will get their Linken's popped.
					If you ground target Spectral Dagger, no Linken's can get popped.</li></ul>
			<li>Spectre gets a 1 second grace period of free pathing after walking off a Spectral Dagger trail. So if you're trying to escape and
				don't need to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape backwards over a cliff
				or across some trees.</li>
			<li>Spectre illusions can also benefit from the Spectral Dagger trail's free pathing.</li>
			<li>You can't use Spectral Dagger's free pathing to get out of spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Mars's Arena, but you can Reality
				to an illusion that's outside to escape.</li>
			<li>Shadow Step illusions have a long enough duration to allow you to toss one out, TP back to base, get some regen or grab items from your
				stash, then Reality back to the illusion.</li>
			<li>Dispersion reflects damage <i>before</i> any reductions are calculated. This means it will deal damage before
				calculating any armor/magic resistance/barriers.</li>
			<li>Spectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Haunt allows her to perpetually farm
				lanes or split push since she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.</li>
			<li>You're invulnerable when flying to an illusion when casting Reality. You can use this to run head first into projectiles like
				Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to negate the stun/damage. If your timing is godlike, you can even use the
				travel invulnerability to dodge things like the AoE stun from Phoenix's Supernova.</li>
			<li>You can use Reality multiple times during a Haunt cast.</li>
			<li>If a target dies, the corresponding Haunt illusion will vanish as well.</li>
			<li>Casting Haunt can be a handy way to break enemy initiator Blink Daggers even if you don't have vision of them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectral Dagger creates a trail on invis units if you took damage from the spell.</li>
			<li>Shadow Step and Haunt illusions have free pathing and will follow you over cliffs. These illusions can be slowed and stunned.</li>
			<li>Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Disruptor's Glimpse, Pudge's Meat Hook, Skywrath Mage's Mystic Flare, and any Hex.
				<ul><li>Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic deals full damage to all types of illusions.</li></ul>
			<li>Enchantress can take control of enemy illusions with Enchant.</li>
			<li>Whenever Spectre Shadow Steps, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to
				mid game her only illusion damage is coming from her Desolate innate, so don't let it proc.</li>
			<li>Spectre's Desolate innate and Dispersion passives can be disabled by Breaks.
				<ul>
					<li>Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include
				Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Naga Siren's Agh's Scepter Ensnare, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Scepter Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike,
				and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Break#Sources">a few others.</a></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Mage Slayer reduces all <i>spell</i> damage from enemies, potentially making it useful at mitigating Dispersion or Desolate innate damage
				from Spectre.</li>
			<li>Spectres generally don't like building BKB or MKB, so magic damage and evasion may prove to be more useful
				against her compared to other carries.</li>
			<li>Spectre cannot travel to illusions with Reality if she's rooted.</li>
