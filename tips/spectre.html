		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectre gets a 1 second grace period of collisionless pathing after walking off a Spectral Dagger trail. So if you
				don't need to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape down a cliff
				or across some trees in the opposite direction.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger gives shared vision on every enemy that get hits by the projectile. This allows you to get
				basic vision on invis enemies.</li>
			<li>If your hero is within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Spectral Dagger. Dagger's max range is
				2000, so you need to get a little closer than max range to properly draw aggro.</li>
			<li>Spectral Dagger can't be reflected by Lotus Orb and completely ignores Linken's Sphere for the primary target.</li>
			<li>Desolate damage never misses. It goes through both blinds and evasion.</li>
			<li>Desolate damage is added as a separate damage instance from your actual right click.</li>
			<li>When farming neutral camps, kill the smaller creeps first. That way you can proc Desolate damage on the big creep.</li>
			<li>Dispersion reflects damage <i>before</i> your physical/magical damage reductions are calculated.</li>
			<li>Spectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Shadow Step allows her to perpetually farm
				lanes or split push since she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.</li>
			<li>You can use Reality multiple times during a Shadow Step cast.
				<ul><li>Each time you use Reality, your hero tosses a Spectral Dagger at the target no matter what the range. So if you
					Shadow Step an enemy across the map, Reality, wait for the cooldown, and Reality again back to the illusion, you'll toss
					an extremely slow global Spectral Dagger at them from across the map. You can use this Spectral Dagger for the free pathing
					just like a normal Dagger.</li></ul>
			<li>If a target dies, the corresponding Haunt illusion will vanish as well.
				<ul><li>You can potentially outplay this mechanic by Daggering and whittling down an enemy with your hero and then swapping
					their Haunt illusion back in to take the last hit with Desolate damage. That way you can quickly return back to where
					you were farming after killing an enemy without having to TP.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Casting Agh's Scepter Haunt can be a handy way to break enemy initiator Blink Daggers even if you
				don't have vision of them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spectral Dagger creates a trail on invis units if you took damage from the spell.</li>
			<li>Haunt illusions have free pathing, but can be slowed and stunned.</li>
			<ul><li>Things that instantly kill illusions like Disruptor's Glimpse, Lion's Hex and Mana Drain, Pudge's Meat Hook, Pugna's Life Drain, 
				Shadow Shaman's Hex, Dagon, and Scythe of Vyse (Hex) also counter Haunt illusions.</li></ul>
			<li>Whenever she Shadow Steps, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to
				mid game her only Haunt illusion damage is coming from Desolate, so don't let it proc.</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Break#Sources">Break mechanic</a> is useful against Spectre to
				disable her Desolate and Dispersion.</li>
			<li>Mage Slayer reduces all <i>spell</i> damage from enemies, potentially making it useful at mitigating Dispersion or Desolate damage
				from Spectre.</li>
			<li>Spectres generally don't like building BKB or MKB, so magic damage and evasion may prove to be more useful
				against her compared to other carries.</li>
			<li>Spectre pushes towers slower than most other carries due to her pretty mediocre AGI gain.</li>
