		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Starting from level 2 of Take Aim, you can hit towers without them hitting you. This is especially useful for high ground
				sieging when used in conjunction with the vision provided by Shrapnel.</li>
			<li>You can cancel Assassinations with the Stop key.</li>
			<li>Assassinate breaks enemy channels when the projectile lands. This interrupt also penetrates spell immunity, however, the projectile
				already needs to be in-flight since spell immunity will prevent and cancel Assassinate cast animations.</li>
			<li>Agh's Assassinate can target, damage, and interrupt spell immune targets.</li>
			<li>Assassinate gives true sight on the target.</li>
			<li>Assassinate provides shared vision around the target. This is useful when dealing with high ground (sieging
				or defending) since you can keep casting it and canceling it on enemies/creeps to see around them.</li>
			<li>With quick fingers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XymNIWNylM">you can use this shared vision to
				"chain" Assassination casts together to find enemies that may be out of vision.</a></li>
			<li>The hero that needs to exploit positioning in lane the most. The Sniper Shuffle is the complex laning
				dance that involves waddling forward, popping the enemy in the face until you get a Headshot, pissing
				them off, running backwards, praying that they don't feel like wasting the energy to kill you, and
				waiting for them to retreat. Then repeat. The better you are at predicting enemy movement, the better
				Sniper you can be.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're getting Assassinated, you will have an icon in your buffs. The shot will get fired when the
				buff timer goes around halfway. Since the the spell gives true sight on your hero, it can't be disjointed
				by traditional invisibility (only Smoke of Deceit and Shadow Dance), but if you're quick you can dodge it
				once the projectile is about to hit you with spells like Nightmare, Disruption, Blinks, or items like Eul's.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrop can save your life from some early game Assassinations.</li>
			<li>Break disables Sniper's passive bonus range from Take Aim.</li>
			<li>Sniper has higher than average night vision (1400). Something to be aware of if you're trying to gank him.</li>
