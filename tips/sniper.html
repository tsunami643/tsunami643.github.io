		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Starting from level 2 of Take Aim, you can hit towers without them hitting you. This is especially useful for high ground
				sieging when used in conjunction with the vision provided by Shrapnel.</li>
			<li>You can use the active on Take Aim to prevent Rubick from stealing your better spells.</li>
			<li>You can cancel Assassinations with the Stop key.</li>
			<li>Assassinate breaks enemy channels when the projectile lands.</li>
			<li>Assassinate gives true sight on the target.</li>
			<li>Assassinate provides shared vision around the target. This is useful when dealing with high ground (sieging
				or defending) since you can keep casting it and canceling it on enemies/creeps to see around them.</li>
			<li>With quick fingers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XymNIWNylM">you can use this shared vision to
				"chain" Assassination casts together to find enemies that may be out of vision.</a></li>
			<li>The hero that needs to exploit positioning in lane the most. The Sniper Shuffle is the complex laning
				dance that involves waddling forward, popping the enemy in the face until you get a Headshot, pissing
				them off, running backwards, praying that they don't feel like wasting the energy to kill you, and
				waiting for them to retreat. Then repeat. The better you are at predicting enemy movement, the better
				Sniper you can be.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Concussive Grenade fully disables enemies during the knockback
				allowing you to briefly stun enemies and cancel their channels.</li>
			<li>Nullifier can purge the Force Staff buff off heroes. However, it does not purge the Hurricane Pike buff. If you're trying to escape
				while Nullified, consider Piking an enemy to get distance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're getting Assassinated, you will have a debuff icon present above your spells. The shot will get fired when the
				debuff timer goes around halfway. There are a few ways to evade it:
				<ul>
				<li>Since the spell gives true sight on your hero, it can't be disjointed by traditional invisibility. However, Smoke of Deceit invis is unique
					and will cancel the targeting or even disjoint the projectile.
				<li>Other disjoints, like from Blinks will only dodge the spell after the projectile is fired.
				<li>Spells that banish you or make you untargetable will cancel the Assassination cast, you don't even need to time it when the projectile is fired.
					This even includes the very quick banish from a Manta Style activation.
				<li>Lastly, spells that grant invulnerability like Bane's Nightmare or being
				cycloned in Eul's won't cancel the targeting, but can potentially dodge the damage from the projectile if you time them right.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Infused Raindrop can save your life from some early game Assassinations.</li>
			<li>Break disables Sniper's passive bonus range from Take Aim.</li>
			<li>Sniper has higher than average night vision (1400). Something to be aware of if you're trying to gank him.</li>
