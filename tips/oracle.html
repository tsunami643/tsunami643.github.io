		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortune's End is one of the few cheap offensive purges in the game, so here are some buffs worth
				noting that can be purged: Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Dark Seer's Surge and Ion Shell, Ember Spirit's Flame Guard,
				Magnus's Empower, Monkey King's Jingu Mastery, Ursa's Overpower, Ghost Scepter, Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/DD/Arcane/Regen (but not Invis) runes.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End also serves as a basic/weak dispel when cast on allies.
				<a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">Here's a list of useful things you can dispel.</a>
				tl;dr - Most silences, slows, roots, and other non-stun debuffs like Dust.</li>
			<li>Every enemy in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets damaged, purged, and rooted upon landing.</li>
			<li>However, only an ally directly targeted by Fortune's End gets dispelled, not all allies in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End provides true sight on only the primary target during the root duration.</li>
			<li>You can be cute and pre-channel Fortune's End on a Blinking or TPing ally so if they run into an enemy,
				you may catch someone in the root/purge AoE (or purge off something like a silence from your ally).</li>
			<li>You can self-target Fortune's End. If an enemy is closing in on you, or you can't target an enemy, start channeling
				it on yourself.</li>
			<li>Pre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay silences. If you are about to enter a team fight
				and you think an enemy Silencer may use Global Silence, start channeling Fortune's End on yourself to automatically purge
				off the silence when it cancels your channel.</li>
			<li>The damage on Fortune's End <i>does not scale</i> the longer you channel it, only the root duration scales.</li>
			<li>You can target Fortune's End on allied couriers.</li>
			<li>If you want to easily make sure the Purifying Flames heal gets purged off an enemy, just cancel Fortune's End's channel by casting Purifying Flames
				on your target. This won't work if your target is less than 400 distance away from you since the Fortune's End projectile will land too quickly
				to purge off the heal.</li>
			<li>You can target Fortune's End on any Cycloned target from an enemy Eul's (or Invoker Tornado or Brewmaster Storm Panda Cyclone) to purge off the Cyclone.
				Cyclones from allied Eul's (including your own) cannot be purged, but you can still target and channel the
				Fortune's End on the Cycloned target.</li>
			<li>Eul's is a valuable item on Oracle since it adds yet another purge to your library. It's an additional purge you can use
				to take the Purifying Flames heal off an enemy.</li>
			<li>The purge from Fortune's End can take the Fate's Edict debuff off allies and enemies. False Promise can also
				purge Fate's Edict off allies.</a>
			<li>Fate's Edict can disarm Rosh.</li>
			<li>Don't use Fate's Edict offensively unless you're a 100% sure your team fully understands how the spell
				works. Yes I know it's a great disarm, but people are dumb and get mad at you for making the enemy immune to magic damage.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict and Purifying Flames both work on enemy, allied, and neutral creeps.</li>
			<li>If you use Fate's Edict on a lane creep, they immediately stop pathing and just stand around for some reason. You can use this
				to stall creeps, especially siege creeps, so that an enemy Glyph won't kill the entire wave during a push.</li>
			<li>This is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them.
				They'll be immune to <s>hurt feelings</s> the nuke damage, but still get the heal.</li>
			<li>Once maxed, each full duration Flame will give ~120 HP to a hero (enemy or ally) with standard magic
				resistance.</li>
			<li>You can cast Glimmer Cape on allies before Flaming them to reduce the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>You rarely want to cast Purifying Flames on an enemy unless you're absolutely sure you can purge
				it or you're sure you can kill the target in the next ~5 seconds (it takes 6 seconds for the heal to
				compensate the damage with standard magic resistance).</li>
			<li>However, if you have a Spirit Vessel charge placed on an enemy target, Flame away. The heal will be heavily
				reduced so you don't really have to worry about it canceling out the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>Max level Purifying Flames can one shot ranged creeps through most of the early/mid game.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied heroes or allied creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames damage can trigger an ally's Aeon Disk, but never your own.</li>
			<li>You can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for deny attacks
				to finish them off. Or if a creep is already below 50%, toss a right click and then cast Purifying Flames
				while your attack projectile is flying.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames allows you to wake allies sleeping under Elder Titan's Echo Stomp or Bane's Nightmare.</li>
			<li>False Promise is your highest range spell. If you're trying to save someone who's about to die, don't bother Edicting, or
				Flaming them first, just use False Promise right off the bat.</li>
			<li>False Promise is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off any disable, including stuns.</li>
			<li>You can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or Lone Druid's Spirit Bear.</li>
			<li>The globe effect above a False Promised hero is supposed to indicate the current state of damage. A fiery red orb means they've
				<i>probably</i> taken more damage than healing, but it's not very consistent.</li>
			<li>A False Promised hero can never have their Blink Dagger be broken because they can't take 'damage' during False Promise.</li>
			<li>Healing Salves, Bottle, and Urn/Spirit Vessel heals can't be broken by damage on a hero that's False Promised, but an
				enemy can take them off with dispels.</li>
			<li>Healing Salves are so strong when combined with False Promise you should honestly carry one around pretty much all game long.</li>
			<li>The only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Abaddon's Borrowed Time, Troll Warlord in Battle Trance,
				or Monkey King's Mischief damage immunity window.</li>
			<li>You can theoretically dodge a False Promise death with Aeon Disk, but it's dependent on a bunch of different factors
				and not really consistently exploitable.</li>
			<li>All the math regarding heals and damage received under False Promise are calculated at the <i>end</i> of the spell. So debuffs
				that interfere with HP regen, like Spirit Vessel or Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, only matter if they're still applied
				by the time False Promise ends.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Axe's Culling Blade can kill through False Promise.</li>
			<li>Windranger's Agh's Shard Powershot can kill through False Promise.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vesseling a False Promised target right before the ult ends will reduce their potential regen.
				Time it close enough so Oracle can't purge it off with Fortune's End. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.</li>
			<li>Bane's Enfeeble reduces health restoration.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast completely prevents health restoration. Ice Blast can even kill an enemy through False Promise
				if they were already below the Shatter HP threshold.</li>
			<li>Shadow Demon Demonic Purging a False Promised target makes it nigh impossible for Oracle to save them
				since every heal he'll pour into his ally will get insta-dispelled.</li>
			<li>Casting Nullifier on a False Promised target will make it very hard for Oracle to heal them
				because of the constant dispelling.</li>
			<li>Casting Eul's on a False Promised target can help dispel a bunch of stacks of Purifying Flame heals.</li>
