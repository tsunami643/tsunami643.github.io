		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Your Prognosticate innate places a buff on your hero that anyone on your team can alt+click to announce in allied chat
				where the next power rune will spawn. It will also tell you what type of rune previously spawned.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End is one of the few cheap offensive dispels in the game, so here are some buffs worth
				noting that can be dispelled off enemies: Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Dark Seer's Surge and Ion Shell, Ember Spirit's Flame Guard,
				Magnus's Empower, Monkey King's Jingu Mastery, Ursa's Overpower, Ghost Scepter, Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/Amplify Damage/Arcane/Regen/Shield
				(but not Invis) runes.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End also serves as a basic dispel when cast on allies. This allows you to remove most silences, slows, fears, roots,
				and other non-stun debuffs like Bounty Hunter's Track off allies.</li>
			<li>Every enemy in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets damaged, dispelled, and rooted upon landing.
				<ul><li>However, only an ally directly targeted by Fortune's End gets dispelled, not all allies in the AoE.</li></ul>
			<li>Fortune's End provides true sight on only the primary target during the root duration.</li>
			<li>You can be cute and pre-channel Fortune's End on an ally who's about to Blink or TP somewhere. If they run into an enemy,
				you may catch someone in the root/dispel AoE from downtown.</li>
			<li>You can self-target Fortune's End. If an enemy is closing in on you, or you can't target an enemy, start channeling
				it on yourself to discourage the enemy from getting within melee range of you.</li>
			<li>Pre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay silences. If you are about to enter a team fight
				and you think an enemy Silencer may use Global Silence, start channeling Fortune's End on yourself to automatically dispel
				off the silence when it cancels your channel.
			<ul>
				<li>Pre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay cyclones. If an Invoker or some Eul's hero is chasing you,
					start casting Fortune's End on yourself and let them "catch" you. You'll immediately dispel the cyclone once it hits you
					and cancels your channel.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The damage on Fortune's End <i>does not scale</i> the longer you channel it, only the root duration scales.</li>
			<li>You can target Fortune's End on allied couriers.</li>
			<li>Because Fortune's End provides vision, you can target your courier with the spell and send it into the Rosh pit to scout with the projectile.</li>
			<li>If you want to easily make sure the Purifying Flames heal gets dispelled off an enemy, just cancel Fortune's End's channel by casting Purifying Flames
				on your target. This won't work if your target is less than 350 distance away from you since the Fortune's End projectile will land before you complete
				the Purifying Flames cast animation.</li>
			<li>You can target Fortune's End on any cycloned target from an enemy Eul's (or Invoker Tornado or Brewmaster Storm Brewling Cyclone) to dispel the cyclone.
				Cyclones from allied Eul's (including your own) cannot be dispelled, but you can still target and channel the
				Fortune's End on the cycloned target.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict can disarm Rosh.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict and Purifying Flames both work on enemy, allied, and neutral creeps.</li>
			<li>This is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them.
				They'll be immune to <s>hurt feelings</s> the nuke damage, but still get the heal.</li>
			<li>You can cast Glimmer Cape on allies before Flaming them and the barrier will block the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>If you have a Spirit Vessel charge placed on an enemy target, Purifying Flame to your heart's content. The heal will be heavily
				reduced so you don't really have to worry about it canceling out the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames has a few noteworthy interactions with how it damages allies:
			<ul>
			<li>Purifying Flames damage can break Salves/Clarities/Urn on allies, but not on yourself.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames damage can trigger an ally's Aeon Disk, but never your own.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames allows you to wake allies sleeping under Elder Titan's Echo Stomp or Bane's Nightmare.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames allows you to build Uproar stacks on an ally Primal Beast.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames can proc an ally Bristleback's passive Quill Spray.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames will break ally Blink Daggers.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied units.</li></ul>
			<li>You can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for deny attacks
				to finish them off. Or if a creep is already below 50%, toss a right click and then cast Purifying Flames
				while your attack projectile is flying.</li>
			<li>False Promise is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off any disable, including stuns.</li>
			<li>If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like False Promise by
				clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.</li>
			<li>You can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or Lone Druid's Spirit Bear.</li>
			<li>The globe effect above a False Promised hero is supposed to indicate the current state of damage. A fiery red orb means they've
				<i>probably</i> taken more damage than healing, but it's not very consistent.</li>
			<li>A False Promised hero can never have their Blink Dagger be broken because they can't take 'damage' during False Promise.</li>
			<li>Healing Salves, Bottle, and Urn/Spirit Vessel heals can't be broken by damage on a hero that's False Promised, but an
				enemy can take them off with dispels.</li>
			<li>The "Pollywog Charm" neutral item artifact has a lot of benefit when used on False Promised allies.</li>
			<li>Be proactive about gathering Healing Lotuses and casting them on allies who are False Promised.</li>
			<li>The only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Abaddon's Borrowed Time, Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Shadow Shaman's Fowl Play,
				and Troll Warlord's Battle Trance.
			<ul><li>You can theoretically dodge a False Promise death with Aeon Disk, but it's dependent on a bunch of different factors
				and not really consistently exploitable.</li></ul>
			<li>All the math regarding heals and damage received under False Promise is calculated at the <i>end</i> of the spell. So debuffs
				that interfere with HP regen, like an enemy Spirit Vessel or Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, only matter if they're still applied
				by the time False Promise ends.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The Fortune's End projectile cannot be disjointed.</li>
			<li>When trying to counter healing from False Promise, be aware that all the heals are calculated at the <i>end</i> of the buff. So
				if you're applying a HP manipulation debuff, it has to be active as False Promise <i>ends</i>, not <i>during</i> the False Promise.
				Here are some sources of heal reduction:
				<ul><li>Items that can reduce healing: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the "Crippling Crossbow" and "Jidi Pollen Bag" neutral item artifacts.</li>
					<li>If applying a Spirit Vessel to a False Promised target, time it close to the end of False Promise so Oracle can't dispel it off early with Fortune's End</li>
				<li>Spells that can reduce healing: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Doom's Doom,
					Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, Dragon Knight's "Frost Dragon" facet, and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/index.php?title=Restoration_Manipulation#Restoration_Classification">a few others.</a>
				<li>Ice Blast can even kill an enemy who's actively False Promised if they were below the Shatter threshold.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Shadow Demon Demonic Purging a False Promised target makes it difficult for Oracle to save them since most heals he'll pour
				into his ally will get insta-dispelled.</li>
			<li>Casting Nullifier on a False Promised target will make it very hard for Oracle to heal them
				because of the constant dispelling.</li>
			<li>You can use certain banishes to kill an enemy who has been False Promised at critical HP.
				Basically, whenever a False Promised target is banished, the game waits for the banish to end before False Promise does its heal/damage math.
				<ul><li>Here's an example: Outworld Destroyer is fighting an enemy who was False Promised at 163 HP. He casts Astral Imprisonment right before
					False Promise ends. While inside the Astral, the enemy loses the False Promise HP freezing buff and can now take damage, but won't receive
					the heal until the banish ends. Now, if OD casts Sanity's Eclipse on the Astral, the Sanity's Eclipse will deal damage to the banished 163 HP
					target and kill them.</li>
					<li>This also works if the banish itself deals damage. Another example: Invoker Tornadoes a 114 HP enemy right before False Promise times out on them.
						When they hit the ground, Tornado will deal its damage first against the 114 HP. If it's lethal, it'll kill the target <i>before</i> False Promise
						does its damage/heal math. Astral Imprisonment damage by itself also works with this.</li>
					<li>The only other hero that can take advantage of this mechanic of dealing damage to an enemy through banishes is Shadow Demon with Disruption allowing
						Shadow Poison and Demonic Purge damage to hit.</li>
					<li>Technically, you can also do this with Eul's landing damage, but they would need to be False Promised at an <i>extremely</i> low HP for Eul's
						damage to be lethal.</li></ul>
			<li>Casting Eul's on a False Promised target can help dispel a bunch of stacks of Purifying Flame heals.</li>
			<li>"Kill check" spells like Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Axe's Culling Blade, and Windranger's "Killshot" facet Powershot can kill through False Promise
				if the enemy was already below the kill check HP threshold when False Promise was cast on them.</li>
			<li>Oracle's Prognosticate innate allows him to tell his team where the next power rune will spawn. So you can probably follow
				the enemy mid pretty confidently for a fight on the rune.
				<ul><li>If you somehow manage to make an illusion of an enemy Oracle, you can see and alt+click the Prognosticate buff
				from that illusion.</li></ul>
