		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Boundless Strike's 'right click' works normally even if Monkey King is disarmed and can never miss.
			</li>
			<li>Spell immune targets ignore all aspects of Boundless Strike.
			</li>
			<li>All on-hit effects can proc from Boundless Strike except for cleave. This includes adding or consuming Jingu stacks.
			</li>
			<li>No matter how many targets are hit in Boundless Strike, only one Jingu Mastery stack is consumed.
			</li>
			<li>If you save your first skill point in Tree Dance, you can skill it up and immediately cast it after taking damage
				since the damage cooldown is only in effect after the spell is learned.
			</li>
			<li>You can't place Jingu stacks on illusions. An optimist sees this as a way to identify the real PL, a pessimist would
				be angry they can't tap that unattended CM illusion rune four times for a free Jingu.
			</li>
			<li>You're considered two 'levels' of high ground elevation up when perched on a tree, but enemies units will have vision
				of you at their ground level whenever you're jumping from tree to tree.
			</li>
			<li>Ground targeted spells will affect you normally when you're on a tree and you can still detonate Techies mines
				while jumping or sitting on a tree.
			</li>
			<li>Casting Boundless Strike or Mischief won't unperch you from a tree, but finishing a Wukong's Command cast will.
				You can use items, like TP, without getting unperched.
			</li>
			<li>You can somewhat outplay a Disruptor Glimpse by letting the Glimpse end your Primal Spring channel. This is inconsistent and
				only works for short range Glimpses, however.
			</li>
			<li>The enemy will hear your Primal Spring channeling sound at wherever the landing is targeted.</li>
			<li>Here are a few Mischief interactions:
				<ul>
				<li>When in Mischief, you won't appear on the enemy minimap at all. Handy for courier sniping or sneaking through warded areas.
				</li>
				<li>Enemy towers and creeps won't attack you when you're in Mischief.
				</li>
				<li>The first 0.2s of Mischief provides damage immunity from any source. You can't disjoint projectiles and it's not a banish,
					but you can prevent taking damage from any incoming projectiles/attacks for that period.
				</li>
				<li>You can instantly drop aggro from creeps by going into Mischief.
				</li>
				<li>Right clicking heroes while in Mischief won't draw aggro from creeps, but creeps will aggro you as soon as you start your attack.
				</li>
				<li>Activating Mischief in most situations will turn you into a Courier, Iron Branch, Clarity, Salve, TP Scroll, Tango, or a banana.
				</li>
				<li>Other transformations are location dependent. Standing near a tree will make you a tree. Rosh pit will make you an Aegis, Cheese, or Refresher Shard.
					Rune spot will make you a bounty or power rune depending on location.
				</li>
				<li>You get 380 movespeed when disguised as a courier, which is faster than your hero with boots. You can force the courier
					transformation by standing within 350 range of your team's courier.
				</li>
				<li>The enemy can't see the Jingu Mastery buff over your head when you're in Mischief, but debuffs (like Dust or Fury Swipes)
					will still show above your disguise.
				</li>
				<li>You can theoretically <a href="./assets/media/monkeyriver.jpg">cram yourself into various armpits around the river to hide yourself as a banana.</a> Too bad I'm not
					about to test this on every graphics setting on every different terrain to see how viable this is, so just assume it's useless.
				</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Wukong's Command soldiers basically have your right click plus whatever items you have.
			</li>
			<li>Wukong's Command soldiers can't bash, but they can proc every other on-hit item effect. Echo Sabre won't make them attack twice,
				but they will apply the slow. They also individually carry whatever auras your hero has, including Radiance.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Your hero will ignore a Monkey King in Mischief when attack+moving. However, enabling the 'Smart Attack Move' option will highlight
				a Monkey King in Mischief and target it.
			</li>
			<li>Tree Dance follows Blink Dagger rules, so DoT spells or things like Urn help make him a little less slippery.
			</li>
			<li>Destroying the tree he's perched on will stun Monkey King for a hefty period of time. Not many heroes can easily take advantage of
				this, but Windranger's Powershot, Ember Spirit's Remnant Activation, Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning, Phoenix's Icarus Dive and Supernova,
				Enigma's Midnight Pulse, Keeper of the Light's Will-O-Wisp, or Batrider's Firefly are a few examples of spells that are either fast enough or large enough to
				catch a Monkey King by surprise.
			</li>
			<li>Don't forget about the tree cutting capabilities of Quelling Blade or Battle Fury late game.
			</li>
			<li>You'll need vision of him to even know what tree he's on to begin with. Heroes with vision providing spells like Beastmaster Hawk,
				Razor's Plasma Field, Disruptor's Thunder Strike, or Puck's Illusory Orb can be handy. Shiva's Guard's active also provides a lot of flying vision.
			</li>
			<li>His Jingu Mastery damage+lifesteal buff can be purged off with basic dispels. This makes heroes like Oracle with Fortune's End in the laning phase or
				Shadow Demon with Demonic Purge in the late game very effective against MK.
			</li>
			<li>Breaking Monkey King will prevent him from adding Jingu stacks on targets he hits and stop him from being able to spend any Jingu buffed attacks.</li>
			<li>The audio cue from Primal Spring is reflected based on your camera placement. If you hear the guzheng to your left, he
				targeted the Spring on the left side of whatever your camera's looking at.
			</li>
			<li>Wukong's Command soldiers' right clicks can be reduced by damage block from Vanguard or Crimson Guard.
			</li>
			<li>You can try shoving Monkey King out of Wukong's Command with a Force Staff if he's near the edge or use spells that Fear/Hypnotize or spells that
				bounce heroes like Inner Fire or Blinding Light.
			</li>
		</ul>
