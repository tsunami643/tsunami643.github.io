		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't be afraid of letting your Spirit Bear wander away from you. Use it to draw aggro from an incoming
				creep wave, stack jungle camps, go shopping for you, teleport to the fountain to heal,
				play checkers with Death Prophet, or just scout for you.</li>
			<li>If your Spirit Bear just died and you're on the losing end of a team fight, don't just cast it again in
				the hopes that you can turn the fight around. Save it for when you respawn.</li>
			<li>You and your team can deny the Spirit Bear to avoid giving its bounty to the enemy. You won't take any Backlash damage if you do.</li>
			<li>Resummoning the Spirit Bear does <i>not</i> count as a 'death' dispel on the Bear. Buffs/debuffs will remain as if it was the
				same old Bear.</li>
			<li>Whenever you Return the Bear, it always appears on the top-right of your hero, regardless of what
				direction you're facing.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you die and the Spirit Bear has Agh's Scepter, Returning the Bear will bring it to your dead body's location.</li>
			<li>Mechanically, think of the Spirit Bear like a 6th hero on your team. Any buffs/debuffs that would last differently on creeps versus heroes last
				the hero duration on the Spirit Bear. For the most part, interactions will behave similarly to clones like Arc Warden's Tempest Double or Meepos.
				<ul><li>Spells that create illusions will fully work on the Bear.</li>
					<li>Ward units that require a certain number 'hero attacks' to kill will treat the Bear like a melee hero, like for Phoenix's Supernova or Pugna's Nether Ward.</li>
					<li>Global team spells like Chen's Hand of God, Centaur Warrunner's Stampede, or Mirana's Moonlight Shadow will work on the Bear. Spells like an enemy Zeus's
						Thundergod's Wrath will also hit the Bear.</li>
					<li>Spells that grant enemies temporary buffs usually work on the Bear. Like Monkey King's Jingu Mastery stacks, Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment
						mana steal, Slark's Essence Shift temporary stat steal, and Silencer's Glaive temporary INT steal.</li>
					<li>Most spells that grant enemies permanent buffs on kills will <i>not proc</i> on the Bear. Like Axe's Culling Blade, Pudge's Flesh Heap,
						Silencer's Brain Drain innate, Slark's Essence Shift innate permanent stat steal, and Storm Spirit Galvanized innate. Also, Urn won't get charges
						on Spirit Bear kills.</li>
					<li>Rubick's Spell Steal and Morphling's Morph cannot be cast on the Bear.</li></ul>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can interact with all map objectives like a hero. Claiming a Shrine of Wisdom with the Bear will correctly give experience to Lone Druid.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear will receive a copy of Lone Druid's neutral item that has an independent cooldown.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can consume Moon Shard.</li>
			<li>Don't forget the Spirit Bear has a separate talent tree that needs to be skilled up independently.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar prevents the enemy from doing <i>anything</i> during its duration because fears are effectively a silence, stun, and a mute combined.
				This includes stopping enemies from activating BKB, Abaddon casting Borrowed Time, or Ursa casting Agh's Scepter Enrage.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar won't move heroes who are Entangled.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Savage Roar can dispel being cycloned by an enemy. Just cast it from whichever unit isn't cycloned, either you or the Bear,
				and the other one will be freed.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can use TP scrolls/Boots of Travel. It's always worth keeping a scroll on your Bear. In lane, let the Bear
				go back to base to heal, then use it as a courier and Return it back. In the mid/late game, it's another way to get it to escape if
				the Return channel gets canceled.
				<ul><li>Keeping a TP scroll on the Bear also allows it to travel to other lanes easily. Teammate getting ganked under the tower but you're busy farming?
					Let the Bear teleport over, Savage Roar the enemies away, then Return back to you.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Spirit Bear Fetch roots targeted heroes, but doesn't disarm them. Enemies and allies can both still
				attack while being Fetched.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Spirit Bear Fetch shares priority with Batrider's Lasso. Whichever spell comes after will override
				the previous one.
				<ul><li>There are some other mechanic similarities between Fetch and Lasso. If you apply a fear (like Savage Roar) to a target that's getting
					Agh's Shard Fetched, it'll end the Fetch (same as Lasso).</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Most spells treat the Spirit Bear like a hero/clone as opposed to a creep. Read the tips above for a more detailed list
				on how certain spells interact with the Bear.</li>
			<li>Bully the Bear in the first few minutes of the laning phase. The Spirit Bear gets tankier as it levels up. Don't worry about harassing
				the hero, just try to whittle down the Bear.</li>
			<li>If you see that the Spirit Bear suddenly has full HP in lane, it's a great time to kill Lone Druid since he
				probably just spawned a fresh one. If you manage to get him Bearless in lane, you just murdered his
				early game.</li>
			<li>Killing the Spirit Bear will net you a pretty hefty gold and experience bounty. If you know the Druid is definitely going to die,
				try killing the Bear first before finishing off the hero.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to kill the Spirit Bear in the mid/late game is with minus armor. Desolator and Assault Cuirass are worthwhile items to consider
				against Lone Druid.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar and other fears can be dispelled off allies with basic dispels, like from Lotus Orb.</li>
