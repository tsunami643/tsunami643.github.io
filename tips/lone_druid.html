		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't be afraid of letting your Spirit Bear wander away from you. Use it to draw aggro from an incoming
				creep wave, stack jungle camps/ancients while you're freefarming, go shopping for you, go back to the
				fountain to heal, burn down a creep wave or enemy jungle camp from across the map with Radiance,
				play checkers with Death Prophet, or just scout for you.</li>
			<li>If your Spirit Bear just died and you're on the losing end of a team fight, don't just cast it again in
				the hopes that you can turn the fight around. Save it for when you respawn.</li>
			<li>You and your team can deny the Spirit Bear to avoid giving its bounty to the enemy. You won't take any Backlash damage if you do.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear only draws creep aggro once it starts an attack on an enemy hero. It doesn't work like normal hero-creep aggro which
				happens as soon as you right click an enemy hero.</li>
			<li>When you level up the Spirit Bear, it basically creates a fresh Bear unit on the spot. You can strategically time when you level up the Bear
				to take advantage of this.
				<ul><li>All the Bear's cooldowns are refreshed when it's leveled up. This can allow you to potentially double Entangle a target. Get a root with the Bear,
					the root is now on cooldown, level up the Bear, no more cooldown on root.</li>
					<li>Leveling up the Bear also resets Savage Roar's cooldown on the Bear. You can use this to double Roar enemies or you can cast Roar for free
						from the Bear because the Bear also gets full mana when leveled up.</li>
					<li>Leveling up the Bear also resets its resummon damage cooldown timer, allowing you to immediately resummon it when you level it up.</li>
					<li>Amusingly, resummoning the Bear does <i>not</i> reset cooldowns. Only HP and mana are reset on a resummoned Bear.</li>
					<li>Leveling up the Bear effectively 'kills' the old Bear and replaces it with a brand new unit. This means any buffs/debuffs that were on the old Bear
						will be gone. So if your Bear gets stunned or Razor Static Linked, you can level it up to instantly remove those debuffs. Be aware that
						buffs, like from double damage or haste runes, will <i>also</i> be removed when the Bear is leveled up.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Whenever you Return the Bear, it always appears on the top-right of your hero, regardless of what
				direction you're facing.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Bear can be returned to your dead body after you get an Agh's Scepter or during Aegis reincarnation.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can activate every rune except for Illusion runes.</li>
			<li>An enemy's Smoke of Deceit will not break if they get close to the Spirit Bear. However, a Smoked Bear behaves the same as a hero. Mmmmm, Smoked Bear.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar gives you a guaranteed channel breaker. If someone's TPing in front of you, don't pray for
				an Entangle, just cast Savage Roar to cancel it.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar won't move heroes who are Entangled, so you can cast it upon rooting someone to prevent them
				from casting any spells or using any items while rooted.</li>
			<li>Entangling Claws's proc chance utilizes <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Random_distribution">pseudo-random distribution (PRD).</a>
				Statistically, about one in every five right clicks should be a root with 20%, but PRD encourages a lower likelihood of 'streaks.' If your Bear goes
				five attacks with no root, chances are now much higher that the Bear's next attack <i>will</i> root thanks to PRD.
				Try to exploit this by priming right clicks on jungle or lane creeps before going for a kill attempt.</li>
			<li>At max level, Savage Roar lasts for a little over 2 seconds. A TP to the fountain takes 3 seconds to complete. Keep this in mind when
				escaping a gank.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar prevents the enemy from doing <i>anything</i> during its duration. This includes activating a BKB, Abaddon casting
				Borrowed Time, or Ursa using Enrage with Agh's Scepter.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can use TP scrolls/Boots of Travel. It's almost always worth keeping a scroll on your Bear. In lane, let the Bear
				go back to base to heal, then use it as a courier and Return it back. In the mid/late game, it's another way to get it to escape if
				the Return channel gets canceled.</li>
			<li>Keeping a TP scroll on the Bear also allows it to travel to other lanes easily. Teammate getting ganked under the tower but you're busy farming?
				Let the Bear teleport over, Savage Roar the enemies away, then Return back to you.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Bear can consume a Moon Shard.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orbs can be cast on the Spirit Bear (and other creep heroes) but they won't actually reflect anything. You can use it to dispel
				the Bear, but don't expect any spells to rebound.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you see that the Spirit Bear suddenly has full HP in lane, it's a great time to kill Lone Druid since he
				probably just spawned a fresh one. If you manage to get him Bearless in lane, you just murdered his
				early game. If you manage to get him Bearless before a push, you get a tower for free.</li>
			<li>Killing the Spirit Bear will net you a pretty hefty gold and experience bounty. If you know the Druid is definitely going to die,
				try killing the Bear first before finishing off the hero.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to kill the Spirit Bear in the mid/late game is with minus armor. Medallion/Solar, Deso,
				and AC are all good items against Lone Druid.</li>
			<li>Applying Break on the Spirit Bear disables the Demolish passive that gives the Bear increased magic resistance and bonus tower damage.</li>
			<li>Bully the Bear in the first few minutes of the laning phase. The Spirit Bear gets tankier as it levels up. Don't worry about harassing
				the hero, just try to whittle down the Bear.</li>
			<li>If Lone Druid is pushing your tower, try to save the Glyph for when he triggers True Form.</li>
			<li>Savage Roar and other fears can be dispelled off allies with basic dispels.</li>
