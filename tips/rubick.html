		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Telekinesis is a damn good disable mainly because Rubick has essentially non-existent cast times. For
				the most part, Telekinesis can be pulled off just as quickly as a hex. So if you're worried an initiator
				is about to Blink in and start a team fight, keep spam casting and canceling it on their initiator so
				that once they Blink in range, you'll instantly pick them up.</li>
			<li>Telekinesis being instant allows you to steal spells that good players will usually avoid letting you get.
				If an Earthshaker just threw out a casual Fissure, they'll almost always cover it with Enchant Totem. However,
				if you pluck them out of the air with an instant Telekinesis disable, you can steal their spell before they get the
				chance to cast another.</li>
			<li>Rubick has to be facing the direction that you want to cast Telekinesis Land, so if you're trying to
				run away after grabbing someone, cast the Land immediately after picking an enemy up, otherwise you'll have
				to turn around again to target the Land.
			<ul><li>Generally, you want to cast the Land as soon as possible anyway so that your allies can see where you're
				dropping the enemy and can plan accordingly.</li></ul>
			<li>You can continue changing the Telekinesis Land location until the spell goes off.
			<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Telekinesis will make allies land as soon as you target Telekinesis Land rather
				than waiting the full duration. This also means you can't change the Land location after you cast it.</li></ul>
			<li>If a Telekinesed enemy gets affected by any items/spells that apply forced movement, they'll immediately drop straight down
				and stun the area underneath.
			<ul><li>When a Telekinesed unit dies, it also immediately drops down and stuns the AoE. You can pick up a weak creep and Fade Bolt it
				to death to instantly get an AoE Telekinsis stun.</li></ul>
			<li>If you're getting chased by multiple heroes, it can be smart to cast the Land towards you, rather than
				away from you. During the Lift's duration, the other enemies will have probably passed your target up,
				so the Land should stun them on the way back.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Telekinesis allows you to throw allies out of things like an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field
				or Slark's Pounce leash.
				<ul><li>You cannot Telekinesis allies out of Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Legion Commander's Duel, so don't even bother.
					It'll put the spell on cooldown and do nothing if you try.</li></ul>
			<li>One of the hallmarks of a strong anti-pusher is the ability to draw aggro from a creep wave off of a
				tower during pushes. Fade Bolt is probably one of the strongest spells in the game to do this, mainly
				because of its zero cast time, huge range, damage reduction ability, and substantial nuke damage. When
				you want to slow down the enemy's push, cast it on the creep wave and the creeps will lose interest in
				hammering your tower and come for you instead.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt bounces always take the shortest possible distance when jumping from target to target.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt will not bounce to enemies that aren't in vision. If you're Fade Bolting a creep wave at night time
				you'll only zap the creeps you see.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt loses damage with each bounce, so you should generally target the ranged creep first when trying to clear waves so you can
				actually get the last hit with full damage.</li>
			<li>Arcane Supremacy cast range bonuses also apply to Rubick's items.</li>
			<li>Spell Steal's debuff amplification is basically the opposite of status resistance in terms of
				mechanics.</li>
			<li>You can Spell Steal through debuff immunity. Just because Enigma is a big golden teardrop doesn't mean
				you can't steal Black Hole through BKB.</li>
			<li>Patience is a virtue. Don't steal spells all willy nilly. Go into a team fight knowing the spells that
				you would want to steal and wait for them to be cast. You'll only be able to steal ~2 spells per team
				fight, so make them count.</li>
			<li>Different spells are useful at different stages of the game. Sure, most ultimates are almost always worth keeping,
				but other spells that help Rubick farm or scout can prove valuable during downtime.</li>
			<li>Rubick has minimal cast times on any stolen spells. Forget everything you know about landing Leshrac's
				Split Earth, be amazed at how you can ejaculate an Earthshaker Fissure in a split second, and revel in how much
				better a spell Zeus's Lightning Bolt is when you don't have to fist pump for half a second to cast it.</li>
			<li>Buffs/spells/summons lingering after a Spell Steal times out or if you Steal another Spell all follow different rules.
				You'll just have to play a bunch of Rubick to find out what works and what doesn't.
				<ul><li>Morph's Attribute Shift is a rare example of a spell that lasts not only after Spell Steal times out, but after death.
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfXnAsBHRY">Even after many deaths.</a></li></ul>
			<li>Stolen spell cooldowns are persistent on Rubick. If a Spell Steal is about to time out and you're sad you never got to use
				your stolen Tidehunter Ravage, don't just cast it for giggles. You may end up screwing yourself over in a future team fight if you steal
				it again.</li>
			<li>There is a slight delay as a stolen spell "projectile" travels to your hero. You can use this window to get one last cast
				of your previously stolen spell, like an invisibility spell, before the new one arrives.</li>
			<li>You can globally check if an enemy hero is an illusion or not by attempting to cast Spell Steal on them. If you clicked on
				an illusion, you'll immediately get an error even if you're not in cast range.</li>
			<li>You can't Spell Steal Morphling's Morph or Tinker's Rearm. Balance reasons? Or because it would simply cause too many programming
				headaches.
				<ul><li>However, you <i>can</i> Spell Steal from a Morphling who is in a Morph. You could theoretically duplicate one of your
					teammates spells this way.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Any stolen spells that have Agh's Scepter upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you
				have an Agh's Scepter.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Any stolen spells that have Agh's Shard upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you
				have an Agh's Shard.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>While Agh's Scepter allows you steal two spells, if you steal a spell that takes two slots,
				you'll still lose your previously stolen spell.</li>
			<li>You can use Earth Spirit's own Stone Remnants with your stolen versions of his spells.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>With Agh's Shard, you can cast a stolen Life Drain into an enemy Pugna's Nether Ward.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Rubick being in your lane automatically adds another ~375 distance that you need to keep in your safety
				zone because of Telekinesis's repositioning ability. Don't let him into your zone.</li>
			<li>Remember that Rubick has much better cast range on your abilities than you do thanks to Arcane Supremacy.</li>
			<li>Rubick is all about capitalizing on your forgetfulness/laziness. "Oh right, they have a Rubick, I should
				have cast Anchor Smash after Ravage. I should have cast Bulwark after Arena. I should have cast
				Sticky Napalm after Flaming Lasso." Put a condom on all of your spells, it's 99% effective.</li>
			<li>Always check what spell Rubick has stolen by clicking on him. If you're Pudge and Rubick just
				Ghostbuster'd your essence, there is a big difference in how the next minute is going to go down if he
				stole Rot or if he stole Meat Hook.</li>
