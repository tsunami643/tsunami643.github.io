		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Telekinesis is a damn good disable mainly because Rubick has essentially non-existent cast times. For
				the most part, Telekinesis can be pulled off just as quickly as a hex. So if you're worried an initiator
				is about to Blink in and start a team fight, keep spam casting and canceling it on their initiator so
				that once they Blink in range, you'll instantly pick them up.</li>
			<li>Telekinesis being instant allows you to steal spells that good players will usually avoid letting you get.
				If an Earthshaker just threw out a casual Fissure, they'll almost always cover it with Enchant Totem. However,
				if you pluck them out of the air with an instant Telekinesis disable, you can steal their spell before they get the
				chance to cast another.</li>
			<li>Rubick has to be facing the direction that you want to cast Telekinesis Land, so if you're trying to
				run away after grabbing someone, cast the Land immediately after picking an enemy up otherwise you'll have
				to turn around again to target the Land.</li>
			<li>Generally you want to cast the Land as soon as possible anyway so that your allies can see where you're
				dropping the enemy and can plan accordingly.</li>
			<li>You can continue changing the Telekinesis Land location until the spell goes off.</li>
			<li>Forced movement on a Telekinesed enemy will immediately drop them straight down, allowing you to pre-emptively get the
				Landing stun.</li>
			<li>When a Telekinesed unit dies, it also immediately drops down and stuns the AoE. You can pick up a weak creep and Fade Bolt it
				to death to instantly get an AoE Telekinsis stun.</li>
			<li>If you're getting chased by multiple heroes, it can be smart to cast the Land towards you, rather than
				away from you. During the Lift's duration, the other enemies will have probably passed your target up,
				so the Land should stun them on the way back.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Telekinesis will make allies land as soon as you target Telekinesis Land rather
				than waiting the full duration. This also means you can't change the Land location after you cast it.</li>
			<li>One of the hallmarks of a strong anti-pusher is the ability to draw aggro from a creep wave off of a
				tower during pushes. Fade Bolt is probably one of the strongest spells in the game to do this, mainly
				because of its zero cast time, huge range, damage reduction ability, and substantial nuke damage. When
				you want to slow down the enemy's push, cast it on the creep wave and the creeps will lose interest in
				hammering your tower and come for you instead.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt bounces always take the shortest possible distance when jumping from target to target.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt loses damage with each bounce, so target the ranged creep when trying to clear waves so you can
				actually get the last hit with full damage.</li>
			<li>Arcane Supremacy cast range bonuses also apply to Rubick's items.</li>
			<li>Spell Steal's debuff amplification is basically the opposite of status resistance in terms of
				mechanics.</li>
			<li>You can Spell Steal through spell immunity. Just because Enigma is a big golden tear drop doesn't mean
				you can't steal Black Hole through BKB.</li>
			<li>This also means you can pop enemy Linken's even if they're spell immune.</li>
			<li>Patience is a virtue. Don't steal spells all willy nilly. Go into a team fight knowing the spells that
				you would want to steal and wait for them to be cast. You'll only be able to steal ~2 spells per team
				fight, so make them count.</li>
			<li>Different spells are useful at different stages of the game. Sure, most ultimates are almost always worth keeping,
				but other spells that help Rubick farm or scout can prove valuable during downtime.
			</li>
			<li>Rubick has minimal cast times on any stolen spells. Forget everything you know about landing Leshrac's
				Split Earth, be amazed at how you can ejaculate an Earthshaker Fissure in a split second, and revel in how much
				better a spell Zeus's Lightning Bolt is when you don't have to fist pump for half a second to cast it.</li>
			<li>Buffs/spells/summons lingering after a Spell Steal times out or if you Steal another Spell all follow different rules.
				You'll just have to play a bunch of Rubick to find out what works and what doesn't.</li>
			<li>There is a slight delay as a stolen spell "projectile" travels to your hero. You can use this window to get one last cast
				of your previously stolen spell, like an invisibility spell, before the new one arrives.</li>
			<li>You can globally check if an enemy hero is an illusion or not by attempting to cast Spell Steal on them. If you clicked on
				an illusion, you'll immediately get an error even if you're not in cast range.</li>
			<li>You can't Spell Steal Tinker's Rearm.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Any stolen spells that have Agh's Scepter upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you
				have an Agh's Scepter.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Any stolen spells that have Agh's Shard upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you
				have an Agh's Shard.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>With Agh's Shard, you can cast a stolen Life Drain into an enemy Pugna's Nether Ward.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Rubick being in your lane automatically adds another ~375 distance that you need to keep in your safety
				zone because of Telekinesis's repositioning ability. Don't let him into your zone.</li>
			<li>Rubick is all about capitalizing on your forgetfulness/laziness. "Oh right, they have a Rubick, I should
				have cast Anchor Smash after Ravage. I should have cast Bulwark after Arena. I should have cast
				Sticky Napalm after Flaming Lasso." Put a condom on all of your spells, it's 99% effective.</li>
			<li>Always check what spell Rubick has stolen by clicking on him. If you're Pudge and Rubick just
				Ghostbuster'd your essence, there is a big difference in how the next minute is going to go down if he
				stole Rot or if he stole Meat Hook.</li>
