		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Telekinesis is a damn good disable mainly because Rubick has essentially non-existent cast times. For
				the most part, Telekinesis can be pulled off just as quickly as a hex. So if you're worried an initiator
				is about to Blink in and start a team fight, keep spam casting and canceling it on their initiator so
				that once they Blink in range, you'll instantly pick them up.</li>
			<li>Telekinesis being instant allows you to steal spells that good players will usually avoid letting you get.
				If an Earthshaker just threw out a casual Fissure, they'll almost always cover it with Enchant Totem. However,
				if you pluck them out of the air with an instant Telekinesis disable, you can steal their spell before they get the
				chance to cast another.</li>
			<li>Rubick has to be facing the direction that you want to cast Telekinesis Land, so if you're trying to
				run away after grabbing someone, cast the Land immediately after picking an enemy up otherwise you'll have
				to turn around again to target the Land.</li>
			<li>Generally you want to cast the Land as soon as possible anyway so that your allies can see where you're
				dropping the enemy and can plan accordingly.</li>
			<li>If you're getting chased by multiple heroes, it can be smart to cast the Land towards you, rather than
				away from you. During the Lift's duration, the other enemies will have probably passed your target up,
				so the Land should stun them on the way back.</li>
			<li>One of the hallmarks of a strong anti-pusher is the ability to draw aggro from a creep wave off of a
				tower during pushes. Fade Bolt is probably one of the strongest spells in the game to do this, mainly
				because of its zero cast time, huge range, damage reduction ability, and substantial nuke damage. When
				you want to slow down the enemy's push, cast it on the creep wave and the creeps will lose interest in
				hammering your tower and come for you instead.</li>
			<li>Fade Bolt bounces always take the shortest possible distance when jumping from target to target.</li>
			<li>Arcane Supremacy's debuff duration amplification is basically the opposite of status resistance in terms of
				mechanics.</li>
			<li>Arcane Supremacy works fully with Rubick's items, making certain item debuffs feel like they last <i>forever</i> on enemies.</li>
			<li>You can Spell Steal through spell immunity. Just because Enigma is a big golden tear drop doesn't mean
				you can't steal Black Hole through BKB.</li>
			<li>Patience is a virtue. Don't steal spells all willy nilly. Go into a team fight knowing the spells that
				you would want to steal and wait for them to be cast. You'll only be able to steal ~2 spells per team
				fight, so make them count.</li>
			<li>Different spells are useful at different stages of the game. Sure, most ultimates are almost always worth keeping,
				but other spells that help Rubick farm or scout can prove valuable during downtime.
			</li>
			<li>Rubick has minimal cast times on any stolen spells. Forget everything you know about landing Leshrac's
				Split Earth, be amazed at how you can ejaculate a Fissure in a split second, and revel in how much
				better a spell Zeus's Lightning Bolt is when you don't have to fist pump for half a second to cast it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Rubick being in your lane automatically adds another ~375 units that you need to keep in your safety
				zone because of Telekinesis's repositioning ability. Don't let him into your zone.</li>
			<li>Rubick is all about capitalizing on your forgetfulness/laziness. "Oh right, they have a Rubick, I should
				have cast Anchor Smash after Ravage. I should have cast Blade Fury after Omnislash. I should have cast
				Sticky Napalm after Flaming Lasso." Put a condom on all of your spells, it's 99% effective.</li>
			<li>Always check what spell Rubick has stolen by clicking on him. If you're Pudge and Rubick just
				Ghostbuster'd your essence, there is a big difference in how the next minute is going to go down if he
				stole Rot or if he stole Meat Hook.</li>
