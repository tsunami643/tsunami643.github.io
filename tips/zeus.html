		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>When playing Zeus, check to see if your lane enemy has a Magic Stick. If you're mid and they do, try
				to exclusively cast Arc Lightning from the high ground. Enemies only get Stick charges if the caster is in vision.
				If they get a charge even when you think you weren't in vision, that means they have a ward that can see you.</li>
			<li>Early game you don't really have the mana to burn to use Lightning Bolt for dewarding unless you're 100%
				sure you know where a ward is. Late game, though, you should be casting it all over the place to counterward.</li>
			<li>Lightning Bolt gives vision, Arc Lightning does not. Cast Lightning Bolt first if you're chasing someone
				to make sure you don't lose your target in fog.</li>
			<li>If you think someone is just about to escape vision, don't risk casting Lightning Bolt on the hero, just
				cast it on the ground near them. Zeus will cancel his animation if it's directly targeted on a hero
				who goes into fog.</li>
			<li>Lightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.</li>
			<li>If you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it.
				If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.</li>
			<li>Ground targeting adds a bonus ~375 range to Lightning Bolt thanks to the search radius.</li>
			<li>Heavenly Jump allows you to pass over cliffs and can even get you out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field which
				most other movement spells get stopped by.</li>
			<li>If you're not moving, Heavenly Jump will jump in place. This can be an issue if you're trying to escape a
				Clockwerk's Power Cogs or Nature's Prophet's Sprout since your hero will stop moving once they reach the edge
				of pathable space. If you're dealing with these spells, be sure to cast Jump before reaching the edge.</li>
			<li>Try to maintain mana for your ult in the early game. The potential of getting a kill on a hero from
				across the map will probably be more useful than the 2 last hits you picked up with Arc Lightning.</li>
			<li>In late game situations, Thundergod's Wrath's biggest asset is the instant global vision it gives of the
				entire enemy team. Don't hesitate to cast it during downtime to verify enemy positions or check if they
				may have Smoked or use it as soon as a team fight starts to get every enemy's location.</li>
			<li>You can use Thundergod's Wrath as temporary counter-initiation against teams with a lot of Blink Daggers.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Nimbus will shock and reveal invis units that walk into the field. It will also shock enemies under Smoke,
				but will not reveal them.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Enemies need vision of the Nimbus unit to right click it, even after it shocks them. Try to place it on cliffs
				or above trees whenever possible.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Nimbus will always attack the unit closest to the center of the field.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Nimbus works normally in a Faceless Void Chronosphere.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Arc Lightning can only bounce to you if Zeus has vision of you.</li>
			<li>Get a Magic Stick if he's spamming Arc Lightning. Just remember that you only get stick charges on spells cast in
				a 1200 radius if the enemy is in vision.</li>
			<li>Buy a Smoke of Deceit against Zeus. Thundergod's Wrath only reveals invisible units, but does not damage
				them. But even then, Smoke is a weird type of invis, so even a Refreshed Thundergod's Wrath wouldn't
				kill you. Buy a Smoke. Use it when escaping with low HP. Laugh at Zeus in all chat.</li>
			<li>Your team should always prioritize building some sources of magic resistance against Zeus. 
				Be it in the form of Cloaks, Glimmer Capes, BKBs, or Pipes.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Melee heroes deal twice as much damage to the Nimbus compared to ranged heroes.</li>
