		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Zeus's auto attack damage and range and animation and projectile speed are all pretty garbage, making it
				almost a necessity to last hit with Arc Lightning. As a result, your lane enemy will almost certainly
				have a Magic Stick. If you're mid, this means you should try to exclusively cast Arc from the high
				ground. Enemies only get Stick charges if the caster is in vision.</li>
			<li>Lightning Bolt gives vision, Arc Lightning does not. Cast Lightning Bolt first if you're chasing someone
				to make sure you don't lose your target in fog.</li>
			<li>Lightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.</li>
			<li>Don't forget about Lightning Bolt's ground targeting capabilities. Early game you don't really have the
				mana to burn to use it for dewarding unless you're 100% sure you know where a ward is. Late game,
				though, you should be casting it all over the place to counterward.</li>
			<li>If you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it.
				If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.</li>
			<li>The ground targeting also adds a bonus ~350 range to the spell thanks to the search radius.</li>
			<li>If you think someone is just about to escape vision, don't risk casting Lightning Bolt on the hero, just
				cast it on the ground right behind them. Zeus will cancel his animation if it's directly targeted on a hero
				who goes into fog.</li>
			<li>Try to maintain mana for your ult in the early game. The potential of getting a kill on a hero from
				across the map will be probably more useful than the 3 last hits you picked up with Arc Lightning.</li>
			<li>In late game situations, Thundergod's Wrath's biggest asset is the instant global vision it gives of the
				entire enemy team. Don't hesitate to cast it during downtime to verify enemy positions or check if they
				may have smoked or use it as soon as a team fight starts to get every enemy's location.</li>
			<li>You can use Thundergod's Wrath as temporary counter-initiation against teams with a lot of Blink Daggers.</li>
			<li>Don't blow your load if you see the enemies have a Pipe up. Try burning off as much of it as you can
				solely with Arc Lightning+Static Field or just wait for it to time out.</li>
			<li>Nimbus will shock and reveal invis units that walk into the field. It will also shock enemies under Smoke,
				but will not reveal them.</li>
			<li>Enemies need vision of the Nimbus unit to right click it, even after it shocks them. Try to place it on cliffs
				or above trees whenever possible.</li>
			<li>The Nimbus will always attack the unit closest to the center of the field.</li>
			<li>The Nimbus works normally in a Faceless Void Chronosphere.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Buy a Smoke of Deceit against Zeus. Thundergod's Wrath only reveals invisible units, but does not damage
				them. But even then, Smoke is a weird type of invis, so even a Refreshed Thundergod's Wrath wouldn't
				kill you. Buy a smoke. Use it when escaping with low HP. Laugh at Zeus in all chat.</li>
			<li>Your team should always prioritize building some sources of magic resistance against Zeus. 
				Be it in the form of Cloaks, Glimmer Capes, Hoods, or Pipes.</li>
