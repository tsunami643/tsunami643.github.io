		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Vacuum can move invulnerable/sleeping targets. This means you can pull enemies like a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning
				or ones that are slept from Naga Song.</li>
			<li>Vacuum destroys trees in a small AoE around the target point.</li>
			<li>If the enemy has spells that can quickly kill your creeps or dispel Ion Shell in the laning phase, cast the spell
				on <i>their</i> creeps instead. Place one on the enemy melee creep tanking the least aggro from your creeps to
				get the most damage.</li>
			<li>For some reason you can cast Ion Shell on enemy heroes. The main use for this would be casting it on
				enemy melee heroes during tower defenses. They'll either kill their whole creep wave or they'll have to
				back off attacking the tower.</li>
			<li>Don't put Ion Shells on frontline creeps. You want to put it on the 2nd/3rd creep in the wave whenever
				you're pushing or farming. The first creep in the wave is going to tank the most damage from the enemy
				wave and will die first.</li>
			<li>Ion Shelling invisible allies is hilarious. The damage isn't large enough to show a huge white bar of
				missing HP building up on an unsuspecting enemy and the purple lines emitting from the Shell don't even
				appear.</li>
			<li>You can put Ion Shell on your allies and have them stand on neutral creeps to farm them for you.</li>
				<ul><li>A few tips to make this strategy even more reliable: Neutral creeps will only aggro your hero if
					you're dealing damage to them within 1800 range. If it's night time and the neutral creeps are sleeping, your
					ally can stand on neutrals without them freaking out. They'll just sit there and die in their sleep.</li>
					<li>This also works at day time, but your ally will need to be Smoked and you'll still need to be further
						than 1800 range away from the creeps.</li></ul>
			<li>You can cast Ion Shell on creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.</li>
			<li>A lot of the time, your allies will benefit from a Surge more than you can. Don't be a scrooge. Surge and
				Shell your allied Doom to help him catch up to an enemy. Help Crystal Maiden put that ward down without
				being hassled for once. Let Batrider Lasso drag someone miles away from their team. Watch Spirit Breaker
				zoom across the entire map in a matter of seconds.</li>
			<li>Don't hesitate to cast Wall of Replica in a 1v1 laning phase situation. It's not the illusion damage that
				you need, it's having an extra controllable unit that you can put an Ion Shell on that makes it a threat.</li>
			<li>A Wall of Replica across the top of the stairs on a tier 3 tower can instantly discourage a push. I know
				it feels bad that you won't be able to make copies if the enemy decides not to push, but if you know that
				you're not going to get good positioning or a good Vacuum, it can be worth it.</li>
			<li>Micro the illusions generated by Wall of Replica. I don't know what their default command is when
				they're created, but I'm guessing it's something along the lines of: <i>"Attack useless things."</i> As soon as
				you score a good Vacuum+Wall, order all the units to attack the highest priority target on the enemy
				team or get them to bully a support out of a fight.</li>
			<li>Wall of Replica illusions carry auras just like all other illusions. Sometimes an offlane/support hero on the enemy team
				is more valuable for their aura rather than trying to get a Replica of the enemy carry.</li>
			<li>Wall of Replica can create illusions of invulnerable (but not hidden/banished) heroes.
				This can be useful against a Juggernaut who is solo Omnislashing you or to make illusions of heroes slept by Naga Song.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The "Defiant Shell" neutral item can be a cute pickup on Dark Seer if you have an Agh's Scepter.
				If someone tries to attack you, you'll Normal Punch them in the face even if you're stunned.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If Seer is solo versus two of you, the support should just sit on his side of the lane very early on.
				The more you can zone him out early, the better, since once he gets a few levels into Ion Shell you won't
				be able to trade hits with him. Wait for him to Shell a creep, then immediately pop out and start poking
				his pointy butt.</li>
			<li>You can purge Ion Shell. This makes Oracle with Fortune's End or Enchantress with Enchant strong lane counters to DS.
				<ul><li>Enchantress can also steal Wall of Replica illusions making her especially annoying for Dark Seer to deal with.</li></ul>
			<li>You can purge Surge. This includes purges from Cyclones (like Eul's Scepter or Invoker's Tornado).</li>
			<li>When attempting to kill Seer, try to save stuns and disables for AFTER he casts Surge to waste some of the Surge duration.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, pay attention to when an illusion is made of you. While you're critting their team
				for buckets o' damage, your Bizarro counterpart is doing the same to your supports. Do your team a favor
				and kill your illusion before it zones them out.</li>
			<li>If you have a Radiance, consider toggling it off if you anticipate enemy initiation for a team fight.
				After you pass through DS's Wall, you can turn it back on.</li>
			<li>A Boots of Bearing or Disperser can help your team quickly scatter if you all got Vacuum'd and slowed by Wall.</li>
		</ul>
