		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you toggle Acorn Shot to autocast, it will always use ground targeting instead of unit targeting. Useful
				if you're trying to plant a tree with Acorn Shot in the middle of a bunch of units.</li>
			<li>Acorn Shot trees give 200 ground vision.</li>
			<li>Acorn Shot can bounce to units in fog.</li>
			<li>Since Acorn Shot behaves as a right click, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.</li>
			<li>Acorn Shot bounces can proc any attack modifiers your hero has. They also ignores disarms. However,
				the shots can high ground miss if you're on a lower terrain than your targets.</li>
			<li>If you fade into a Shadow Blade after Acorn Shot goes out, you can get the backstab on all enemies and you don't lose
				invisibility. Silver Edge does not work the same way.</li>
			<li>Acorn Shot attacks can be affected by miss chance, but not disarms. The attacks will still land if you're disarmed.</li>
			<li>Even if Acorn Shot attacks miss, the slow still lands.</li>
			<li>Acorn Shot's initial cast range can be increased by attack range bonuses <i>and</i> cast range bonuses.</li>
			<li>Since the tree from Acorn Shot provides collision, you can use it to push yourself out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field or
				Slark's Pounce leash. <a href="https://youtu.be/C-573mQSYNI?t=9">Just cast the Acorn Shot behind your hero, but inside the selection circle.</a>
				You can also use this to break allies out of those spells.</li>
			<li>If you target Bushwack at max range and cancel the cast backswing, you can shoot an Acorn Shot tree into the Bushwack AoE to beat
				the net projectile. The margin is extremely tight, however.</li>
			<li>An Acorn Shot tree will never time out if targets are currently Bushwhacked to it.</li>
			<li>Bushwack gives flying vision around its landing location even if it doesn't latch anything.</li>
			<li>Bushwack can connect on fogged enemies, but not invisible enemies.</li>
			<li>Be aware that if your allies apply any sort of forced movement to a Bushwacked target, they'll instantly be freed. So if Queen of Pain
				Sonic Waves a Bushwacked Anti-Mage, she better be using it to get the kill.</li>
			<li>You have significantly more survivability when you're hugging trees. Pay attention to your buffs and try to keep
				Scurry enabled whenever possible.</li>
			<li>Your Acorn Shot tree can enable Scurry evasion.</li>
			<li><a href="https://youtu.be/0HhhVDljr4s?t=139">You can push yourself down cliffs by letting the active Scurry buff time out in an
				unpathable location inside trees.</a></li>
			<li>You can use the recoil from Sharpshooter to move up and down cliffs to escape. It works while rooted or leashed, allowing
				you to break out of things like Slark's Pounce. You can even get out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Mars's Arena.</li>
			<li>Enemies can hear you winding Sharpshooter up even through fog.</li>
			<li>You are <i>not</i> disabled during the Sharpshooter windup. You can't move or attack, but you can cast all your spells or items (except TP).</li>
			<li>However, you are limited to targeting spells and items perfectly in the direction you're facing. If you target
				something outside of the angle allowed, nothing will happen until after Sharpshooter ends. If you want to re-target a spell/item to
				fix that, issue a stop or hold command, then try targeting again.</li>
			<li><i>Nothing</i> can cancel Sharpshooter except hitting the subspell hotkey or dying. Stuns, silences, banishes, doesn't matter, this squirrel's gonna
				get her nut.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you see a Hoodwink running up to you and there are no trees around, just start spamming your Quelling Blade (if you have one)
				on the ground near you. If you're fast, you'll likely instantly cut the Acorn Shot tree she makes before you get Bushwacked to it.</li>
			<li>Destroying the tree that heroes are Bushwhacked to will immediately cancel the stun.</li>
			<li>If you activate Spider Legs right before getting Bushwacked, you'll destroy the tree you move to and immediately free yourself.</li>
			<li>Applying any type of forced movement to a Bushwhacked hero will also free them. Like from a Force Staff or Snapfire's
				Firesnap Cookie.</li>
			<li>If a melee hero Lotus Orb reflects Acorn Shot, the reflected shots will only deal damage if the hero is within
				350 + melee hero attack range (default 150) of the bounce targets. This is because Acorn Shot considers your hero
				as launching the bounce attack from their current location and melee heroes aren't allowed to hit targets more than 350
				range away.</li>
			<li>Nothing can stop Sharpshooter from going off so don't bother wasting spells trying to cancel it. Just try to juke
				the projectile.</li>
			<li>The Sharpshooter debuff (the slow and the break) can be removed with basic dispels.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw's tendency to destroy all things trees makes it very difficult for Hoodwink to get Bushwack stuns.</li>
		</ul>
