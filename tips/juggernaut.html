		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Common knowledge, but you can activate Blade Fury while TPing and your channel won't break. Use this to
				go spell immune if someone is walking up to you while you're TPing or use it to show up to your
				destination pre-spell immune.</li>
			<li>The mechanics behind right clicking during Blade Fury: Does it deal damage to heroes? No. Does it deal
				damage to towers? Yes. Does it apply/refresh orb effects like Orb of Venom? Yes.</li>
			<li>You can Blade Fury into a Black Hole or Chronosphere without it getting canceled.</li>
			<li>Rather than frantically clicking around an enemy while attempting to Blade Fury them, use a follow
				command (default M+left click) on the target hero. This makes you impossible to juke and takes the
				guesswork out of following the enemy.</li>
			<li>Jughead is a competent solo pusher with staying power that the Healing Ward gives creeps.</li>
			<li>Healing Ward gives a fair amount of vision (500/500) and moves pretty fast this makes it a clever tool
				for scouting if you don't need the heal. Use it to scout Rosh or check uphill for you.</li>
			<li>You can cast spells (except Blade Fury) and use items while mid-Omnislash (except TPs).</li>
			<li>If you're 6, constantly be looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to create one is to
				quickly kill the enemy's creep wave and then pounce on him while he's wondering why you got four last
				hits and he has yet to get one. The lane push will be worth the kill.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If he's 6, he's constantly looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to avoid getting
				owned is to always stay next to your creeps and to always be a mile away from your wave when it dies.</li>
			<li>Going Ethereal (from Ghost Scepter, Ethereal Blade, or Pugna's Decrepify) protects you from damage
				received during Omnislash. If you're the only target to Omnislash, it'll stop his ult completely. Eul's
				can also be used to evade Omni damage, but he'll keep slashing at the Tornado and will continue after
				you come down.</li>
			<li>Keep tabs on Jugg's mana in lane. Blade Fury and/or Omnislash are usually free kills if Jugg has the
				mana to cast them. It also means that he can't escape easily if he doesn't have the mana to cast Blade
				Fury.</li>
			<li>HOLY PEACHES, PLEASE KILL THE HEALING WARD. It takes 1 attack. Doesn't matter if it's a 1k crit from
				Drow or a love tap from a 10 damage Visage Familiar, KILL IT.</li>
			<li>At early levels, help your teammate diffuse Omnislash damage by running in and taking some bounces. At
				late levels or post-Agh, play your teammate the world's smallest violin and run away.</li>
			<li>You can Salve through a level 1 Blade Fury. The chances of being able to use a Salve without Jugg's ally
				taking it off or him just right clicking you at a level 1 or 2 gank are probably slim, but this is one
				of those tips that everyone likes to share and I want in on the action.</li>
			<li>DUDE I'M SERIOUS, KILL THE HEALING WARD.</li>
