		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Common knowledge, but you can activate Blade Fury while TPing and your channel won't break. Use this to
				go spell immune if someone is walking up to you while you're TPing or use it to show up to your
				destination pre-spell immune.</li>
			<li>The mechanics behind right clicks during during Blade Fury.
				<ul><li>They will not deal damage to heroes.</li>
					<li>They will deal damage to towers.</li>
					<li>They will apply/refresh on-hit effects like Orb of Venom or Desolator.</li>
					<li>They will roll for proc chances on items like Basher or Maelstrom.</li>
					<li>They will not cleave from Battle Fury or Empower.</li>
					<li>They will add to 'hero attacks' for ward-type units (Nether Ward,
						Serpent Wards, Supernova, Tombstone).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You can Blade Fury into a Black Hole or Chronosphere without it getting canceled. You'll still get disabled, though.</li>
			<li>Rather than frantically clicking around an enemy while attempting to Blade Fury them, use a follow
				command (default M+left click) on the target hero. This makes you far more difficult to juke and takes the
				guesswork out of following the enemy. Just beware if the enemy is about to go into fog.</li>
			<li>Jughead is a competent solo pusher with staying power that the Healing Ward gives creeps.</li>
			<li>Healing Ward gives a fair amount of vision (600 day/night) making it a clever tool for scouting if you don't
				need the heal. Use it to scout Rosh, check uphill, or give vision on cliffs for counterwarding.</li>
			<li>You can cast spells (except Blade Fury) and use items (except TPs and Blink Dagger) while mid-Omnislash.</li>
			<li>If you're 6, constantly be looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to create one is to
				quickly kill the enemy's creep wave and then pounce on them while they're wondering why you got four last
				hits and he has yet to get one. The lane push will be worth the kill.</li>
			<li>Only the first hit of Omnislash is blocked by Linken's Sphere. The rest of the bounces will continue and
				deal damage as expected.</li>
			<li>Omnislash damage works through disarms.</li>
			<li>Each Omnislash attack alternates between hitting the front and back of a hero.</li>
			<li>Casting Omnislash applies a basic dispel on Jugg.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If he's 6, he's constantly looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to avoid getting
				owned is to always stay next to your creeps and to always be a mile away from your wave when it dies.</li>
			<li>Going Ethereal (from Ghost Scepter, Necro's Ghost Shroud, Pugna's Decrepify, etc.) protects you from damage
				received during Omnislash. Eul's can also be used to momentarily evade Omni damage.</li>
			<li>Keep tabs on Jugg's mana in lane. Blade Fury and/or Omnislash are usually free kills if Jugg has the
				mana to cast them. It also means that he can't escape easily if he doesn't have the mana to cast Blade
				Fury.</li>
			<li>HOLY PEACHES, PLEASE KILL THE HEALING WARD. It takes 1 attack. Doesn't matter if it's a 1k crit from
				Drow or a love tap from a dominated ranged creep, KILL IT.</li>
			<li>At early levels, help your teammate diffuse Omnislash damage by running in and tanking some bounces. At
				late levels or post-Agh's, just run away because he'll probably kill you both.</li>
			<li>DUDE I'M SERIOUS, KILL THE HEALING WARD.</li>
			<li>Each Omnislash attack alternates between hitting the front and back of a hero. The first attack is always on the back.
				You can use this to outplay low level Omnislashes with heroes like Bristleback or Mars by rotating your hero 180 degrees
				in between slashes to make sure Jugg keeps hitting the reduced side.</li>
