		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.</li>
			<li>Landing multiple Razes adds stacking amounts of damage on neutral/enemy targets and Roshan. Each Raze landed refreshes the
				debuff.</li>
			<li>Landing multiple Razes on a hero can sometimes be challenging when the game's pathing doesn't cooperate.
				A handy console command to work around this is:
				<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new">cl_dota_alt_unit_movetodirection true</font><br><br>
				Paste that in your <font face="courier new"><i>dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\autoexec.cfg</i></font> (create the file if it's not already there).
				This command makes it so that whenever you're holding down ALT, your hero ignores pathing and tries to move in a straight line towards
				where you right clicked. You can also enable the "Directional Move" hotkey in the settings, but this ALT modifier may be easier to use
				once you get used to it.</li>
			<li>You can try to mask some of the Shadow Raze cast animation while turning. If you're facing one direction, click where you want to angle the
				Raze and immediately hit the spell hotkey. Your hero will already begin the Raze cast animation while you're spinning giving the enemy less time
				to react. For a full 180Â°, nearly half the cast animation will be complete by the time you finish turning.</li>
			<li>If you're having a hard time in lane, go head to the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls.</li>
			<li>One of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching on since he can make use of all three attributes
				and frequently gets a Bottle.</li>
			<li>Ward type units, like Clockwerk's Cogs, have souls for some reason. If you're very tryhard, you can coordinate you,
				one other hero, and a Clockwerk in the fountain to get some early Necromastery souls before the game starts.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Shadowraze Applies Attack Damage" talent basically adds an <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">
				instant attack</a> on top of each Raze. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers.
				If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit in the Shadowraze AoE.</li>
				<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>The "Shadowraze Applies Attack Damage" talent also works with your Agh's Shard
					Necromastery. One target in the Shadowraze AoE will randomly receive the Necromastery fear attack and put the spell on cooldown.</li></ul>
			<li>Presence of the Dark Lord does not affect enemies who don't have vision of you. Therefore, you can click on enemies
				and look if they have the Presence debuff to check if they can see you.</li>
			<li>You can use a 'stop' command to cancel your Requiem of Souls cast animation without putting it on cooldown.</li>
			<li>Almost the entire Requiem of Souls cast animation is hidden by invis rune or Shadow Blade invisibility.</li>
			<li>Unlike other fears, Requiem fears enemies away from Shadow Fiend, rather than towards their fountain.</li>
			<li>Try to use the Requiem fear to set up easy triple Razes on a target who can't juke.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter upgraded Requiem will also fear enemies when the lines return.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Destroying SF's laning phase is the textbook example of "shutting down" a hero. The hero doesn't have
				any escapes and isn't very tanky. He can recover by stacking and razing down jungle camps so if you <i>really</i>
				want to make sure he doesn't become a threat, keep vision over his jungle as well.</li>
			<li>Don't forget that he mini-ults when he di--too late, you ate it.</li>
			<li>Remember that SF loses some Necromastery souls on death. So if he just respawned or bought back, he's not going to be at full power.</li>
			<li>Raindrops or activating a Pipe can block the 'landing' damage on Eul's, allowing you to Blink out if SF tries to Cyclone+Ult combo you. This tip
				is only useful against bad SFs, though. A skilled SF will time the ult so you're already in it by the time you land.</li>
			<li>The Requiem slow and fear debuff can be dispelled even with weak dispels.</li>
