		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.</li>
			<li>Landing multiple Razes adds stacking amounts of damage on neutral/enemy targets and Roshan. Each stack lasts 8 seconds.</li>
			<li>If you're having a hard time in lane, go head to the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls.</li>
			<li>One of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching on since he can make use of all three attributes
				and frequently gets a Bottle.</li>
			<li>Ward type units, like Clockwerk's Cogs, have souls for some reason. If you're very tryhard, you can coordinate you,
				one other hero, and a Clockwerk in the fountain to get some early Necromastery souls before the game starts.</li>
			<li>Presence of the Dark Lord does not affect enemies who don't have vision of you. Therefore, you can click on enemies
				and look if they have the Presence debuff to check if they can see you.</li>
			<li>Almost the entire Requiem of Souls cast animation is hidden by invis rune or Shadow Blade invisibility.</li>
			<li>Unlike other fears, Requiem fears enemies away from Shadow Fiend, rather than towards their fountain.</li>
			<li>Try to use the Requiem fear to set up easy triple Razes on a target who can't juke.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter upgraded Requiem will also fear enemies when the lines return.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Destroying SF's laning phase is the textbook example of "shutting down" a hero. The hero doesn't have
				any escapes and isn't very tanky. He can recover by stacking and razing down jungle camps so if you <i>really</i>
				want to make sure he doesn't become a threat, keep vision over his jungle as well.</li>
			<li>Don't forget that he mini-ults when he di--too late, you ate it.</li>
			<li>Remember that SF loses half his Necromastery souls on death. So if he just respawned or bought back, he's not going to be at full power.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrop can block the 'landing' damage on Eul's, allowing you to Blink out if SF tries to Cyclone+Ult combo you. Activating a Hood/Pipe/Eternal Shroud
				also works.</li>
			<li>The Requiem slow and fear debuff can be dispelled even with weak dispels.</li>
		</ul>
