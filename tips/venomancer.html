		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Are you struggling at maintaining creep equilibrium in the laning phase because of your Plague Wards? Watch this
				instructional video to help solve that problem.<br>
				<div class="video-wrapper">
					<iframe width="672" height="420" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hbTklp4lknI?t=41?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>tl;dw - Use the stop key and use unified unit orders. No one is forcing Plague Wards to constantly
				attack. Stop them if there are no heroes around, sic 'em all on a creep at the same time to last hit or
				deny, put them up on cliffs and tell them to shut up so they don't alert an enemy who didn't know you
				could see them.
			<ul><li>The "Unified unit orders" option is also useful when chasing enemies down with Plague Wards. When you throw one up ahead, don't
				waste time box-selecting, just issue a unified ctrl+right click on the enemy hero.</li></ul>
			<li><a href="https://youtu.be/G7W3VhXu0JY?t=22">There are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the
				Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it.</a> You can use this to potentially hide a Plague Ward for vision.
				Just be sure to issue a stop command to it so it won't attack anyone walking into the pit.</li>
			<li>Plague Ward attacks apply a half-damage Poison Sting debuff, but the slow is the same value as your hero's Poison Sting.</li>
			<li>Plague Wards have collision and can be used to block narrow paths.</li>
			<li>Try to deny your Plague Wards in lane. Use your other Plague Wards to help deny dying Plague Wards.</li>
			<li>Spam Plague Wards for vision. Seriously. Just slap them everywhere. They're super annoying for enemies to deal with and
				have 800 day/night vision.</li>
			<li>When jungling, try to place your Plague Wards outside of the spawn box so you don't block new camps from spawning. Plague Wards last forever and
				will not time out before a camp respawns.
				<ul><li>Alternatively, Plague Wards are great for blocking enemy camps.</li></ul>
			<li>Veno is damn good at harassing enemies in the jungle. Plague Wards have great cast range, short cooldown,
				and last forever.</li>
			<li>The secondary Noxious Plague projectiles can hit invisible and fogged enemies.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Venomous Gale will <i>not</i> stun enemies who dispel the debuff with BKB/debuff immunity.</li>
			<li>Refreshers are pretty useless on Veno since all his debuffs are only refreshed when reapplied, they don't stack.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for opportunities to deny your allies. You can't deny allies under Poison Sting or Noxious Plague, but
				you can deny allies under Venomous Gale.</li>
			<li>Venomous Gale and Poison Sting can be dispelled.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If you dispel Agh's Shard Venomous Gale, you'll get stunned. However, if the dispel comes with
				debuff immunity (like activating BKB) you won't get stunned.</li>
			<li>Poison Sting damage is classed as "HP removal" so it does not cancel Blink Daggers or consumable healing. You can use a
				Salve/Clarity/Bottle without fear of it getting canceled.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Damaging enemy heroes will remove Plague Wards off them if Veno took the "Plague Carrier" facet.</li>
			<li>You can't disjoint the initial or the secondary Noxious Plague projectiles.</li>
			<li>If you're panicking in your fountain because you think you're about to die to Veno's damage, consider a few options:
				<ul><li>Buy a Faerie Fire.</li>
					<li>Buy Blood Grenades.</li>
					<li>Buy a Cloak if you have the gold. You can sell it back a few seconds later (but it turns your gold unreliable).</li>
					<li>Pray.</li>
					</ul>
