		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Are you struggling at maintaining creep equilibrium in the laning phase because of your Plague Wards? Watch this
				instructional video to help solve that problem.<br>
				<div class="video-wrapper">
					<iframe width="672" height="420" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hbTklp4lknI?t=41?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>tl;dw - Use the stop key and use unified unit orders. No one is forcing Plague Wards to constantly
				attack. Stop them if there are no heroes around, sic 'em all on a creep at the same time to last hit or
				deny, put them up on cliffs and tell them to shut up so they don't alert an enemy who didn't know you
				could see them.</li>
			<li>This is also useful when chasing enemies down with Plague Wards. When you throw one up ahead, don't
				waste time box-selecting, just issue a unified ctrl+right click on the enemy hero.</li>
			<li>Plague Ward attacks apply a half-damage Poison Sting debuff, but the slow is the same value as your hero's Poison Sting.</li>
			<li>Plague Wards have collision and can be used to block narrow paths.</li>
			<li>Try to deny your Plague Wards in lane. Use your other Plague Wards to help deny dying Plague Wards.</li>
			<li>Spam Plague Wards for vision. Seriously. Just slap them everywhere. They're super annoying for enemies to deal with and
				have 800 day/night vision.</li>
			<li>When jungling, try to place your Plague Wards outside of the spawn box so you don't block them. Plague Wards last forever and
				will not time out before a camp respawns.</li>
			<li>Veno is damn good at harassing enemies in the jungle. Plague Wards block camps, have an awesome cast range, short cooldown,
				last forever, and are impossible for enemies to kill quickly enough without blocking a camp themselves.</li>
			<li>In a team fight, your job is to get some poison every hero in the vicinity. Each of your poisons last for ~15 seconds,
				so you either need your Poison Sting or Venomous Gale on everyone to give a final tick of lethal damage post-Nova.</li>
			<li>Refreshers are pretty useless on Veno since all his debuffs are only refreshed when reapplied, they don't stack.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for opportunities to deny your allies. You can't deny Poison Sting or Nova, but
				you can deny allies under Venomous Gale.</li>
			<li>Venomous Gale and Poison Sting can be dispelled.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If you activate a source of spell immunity against Agh's Shard Latent Toxicity, you
				<i>will</i> still get stunned because the debuff getting dispelled triggers before spell immunity activates.</li>
			<li>Poison Sting does not cancel consumable healing. If you're about to die to the damage, use your Salve/Bottle without
				fear of it getting canceled.</li>
			<li>If you're panicking in your fountain because you think you're about to die to Veno's damage, consider three options:
				<ul><li>Buy a Faerie Fire.</li>
					<li>Buy a Cloak if you have the gold. You can sell it back a few seconds later.</li>
					<li>Pray.</li>
					</ul>
