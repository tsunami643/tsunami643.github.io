		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Death Prophet will walk to wherever you cast Crypt Swarm if it's not within the spell's cast range. This is important to know
				during chases or pushes, because the projectile actually hits units twice as far as the cast range.</li>
			<li>Crypt Swarm can use unit targeting or ground targeting. If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground
				targeting, otherwise Death Prophet may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.</li>
			<li>If you ground target Crypt Swarm from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it.
				If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.
				<ul><li>This is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever
					directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed
					through fog.</li></ul>
			<li>You can't use two Spirit Siphon charges on one enemy at the same time, but you can have multiple Siphons out at once.
				If you're getting ganked, try to Siphon all of the heroes chasing you, or neutral/enemy creeps for the HP and bonus
				move speed.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Siphon heal is independent of the damage dealt. You can Siphon units with increased magic resistance, like
				siege creeps, Mud Golems, or Warpine Raiders and still heal the expected amount of HP.</li>
			<li>Refresher Orb/Shard restores all Spirit Siphon charges.</li>
			<li>Refreshing and recasting Exorcism won't double up the spell, but instead cause the previous cast to end first,
				making the ghosts return to Death Prophet and heal her.</li>
			<li>Exorcism ghosts deal physical damage. As a result, it does more/less damage based on enemy armor values.</li>
			<li>Your Exorcism spirits will target whoever you right click. You can change targets even if you're
				disabled/stunned/cycloned.</li>
			<li>When pushing undefended towers, stand closer to the tower. This will decrease the amount of time your
				ghosts spend circling back to you after hitting the structure and allow you to deal more damage.</li>
			<li>A weird random interaction is Exorcism ghosts can kill Techies' Proximity Mines and Venomancer's Plague Wards, but
				can't damage any other type of ward unit. It's tricky to pull off consistently, but it does happen.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The slow from Agh's Scepter Exorcism Ghosts works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spirit Siphon won't break if you go into fog, but the Siphon itself doesn't provide shared vision of your hero.
				Death Prophet can still track you by following the Siphon particles, but you may be able to avoid a few right clicks
				by juking in trees.</li>
			<li>You can click on her and check her buffs to see the duration left on Exorcism.</li>
			<li>Chasing her down mid-Exorcism is a dangerous game. Besides the fact that the ghosts do a lot of damage,
				it's entirely likely that the ghosts will completely fill up her HP once they're done and she'll just
				turn around and destroy you.</li>
			<li>Despite being physical damage, Exorcism ghosts ignore damage block and evasion, so Vanguard or Crimson Guard
				won't reduce their damage. Only armor helps.</li>
			<li>You can target a hero that has defensively Eul's cycloned themselves with Nullifier to cancel it or you can cast
				Nullifier on them to prevent Eul's from activating. Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge works similarly.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel, Skadi, and Shiva's can reduce the HP regen she'll gain from Spirit Siphon and Exorcism.</li>
			<li>Mage Slayer reduces <i>spell</i> damage, meaning it can also reduce the amount of damage dealt from Exorcism.</li>
