		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Krobe will walk to wherever you cast Crypt Swarm if it's not within 600 range even though she can hit
				units 1100 range away. Keep this in mind during chases or pushes.</li>
			<li>Crypt Swarm can use unit targeting or ground targeting. If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground
				targeting, otherwise Death Prophet may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.</li>
			<li>You can't use two Siphon charges on one enemy at the same time, but you can have multiple Siphons out at once.
				If you're getting ganked, try to Siphon all of the heroes chasing you, or neutral/enemy creeps for the HP and bonus
				movespeed.</li>
			<li>The Spirit Siphon heal is independent of the damage dealt. You can Siphon units with increased magic resistance, like
				siege creeps or Mud Golems, and still heal the expected amount of their max HP.</li>
			<li>Refresher Orb/Shard restores all Spirit Siphon charges.</li>
			<li>Refreshing and recasting Exorcism won't double up the spell, but instead cause the previous cast to end first,
				making the ghosts return to Death Prophet and heal her.</li>
			<li>Exorcism ghosts deal physical damage. As a result, it goes through BKB, does more/less damage based on
				armor values and is generally relevant all game long.</li>
			<li>Your Exorcism spirits will target whoever you right click. You can change targets even if you're
				disabled/stunned/cycloned.</li>
			<li>When pushing undefended towers, stand closer to the tower. This will decrease the amount of time your
				ghosts spend circling back to you after hitting the structure and allow you to deal more damage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can click on her and check her buffs to see the duration left on Exorcism.</li>
			<li>Chasing her down mid-Exorcism is a dangerous game. Besides the fact that the ghosts do a lot of damage,
				it's entirely likely that the ghosts will completely fill up her HP once they're done and she'll just
				turn around and destroy you.</li>
			<li>Despite being physical damage, Exorcism ghosts ignore damage block and evasion, so Vanguard or Crimson Guard
				won't reduce their damage.</li>
