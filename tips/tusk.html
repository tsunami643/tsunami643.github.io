		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range
				Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to 'reverse Shard' yourself is to target the cast of Ice Shards in front of your hero model, but inside
				of the white selection circle. With surprisingly little practice you can start cliffing yourself like a pro.</li>
			<li>The Ice Shards projectile provides flying vision as it travels. The vision remains for 2 seconds once the Shards
				reach their destination.</li>
			<li>You can use Shards to help get vision of a neutral creep in the jungle to Snowball to if you're
				getting ganked and there are no good targets nearby.</li>
			<li>You, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable when rolling in a Snowball. This means
				that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.</li>
			<li>You can pull allies into Snowball even when they're cycloned.</li>
			<li>Think about your Snowball target when trying to save yourself or allies. Don't always target enemy heroes,
				they may move in a way that'll drag you further into a fight. Look for neutrals or lane creeps that
				will take you to more predictable locations when your Snowball ends.</li>
			<li>Snowball isn't blocked by Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>Snowballing a target with Lotus Orb will put them into a Snowball targeting you once your Snowball lands on them. They can't
				launch this Snowball early and they'll be stuck in it for the full duration.</li>
			<li>You can cast Shards and Tag Team while you're in the Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can pick up new heroes while you're rolling mid-Snowball by right clicking on them.</li>
			<li>You can't Snowball allies that are affected by Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Batrider's Flaming Lasso.</li>
			<li>Tag Team works on neutrals and Roshan.</li>
			<li>Since the Tag Team bonus damage is calculated as "+green" bonus damage for each attack, you can cleave, lifesteal, and crit off it. This includes
				boosting Walrus Punch's crit, so always enable Tag Team before Walrus Punching for a big damage increase.</li>
			<li>Tag Team's effects only work on attacks from Tusk, units Tusk owns, allied heroes, and allied illusions (though illusions
				only apply the slow since the damage bonus is "+green" damage). Attacks from units/summons owned by allied heroes don't get any Tag Team bonuses.</li>
			<li>You can Walrus Punch the courier.</li>
			<li>Walrus Punch attacks will never miss. This includes Walrus Punch right clicks if you take the "% Chance Walrus Punch" talent.</li>
			<li>Walrus Punch (and Agh's Scepter Walrus Kick) breaks channels, even if the enemy is spell immune.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Walrus Kick searches for any valid targets in a 250 radius around your hero. The target
				doesn't need to be in front of you to get Kicked, they just need to be within 250 range of your hero. It prioritizes heroes over other units and will Kick
				the closest hero if multiple are in the AoE.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can cast Agh's Shard Frozen Sigil while you're in Snowball.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can load the Agh's Shard Frozen Sigil into your Snowball.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>The Agh's Shard Frozen Sigil provides ground vision underneath it. You can use it to scout.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in
				your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't
				seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.</li>
			<li>Tusk and all his allies are invincible in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks
				apart.</li>
			<li>Tusk can't cast Snowball when rooted.</li>
			<li>Snowball completely ignores Linken's Sphere.</li>
			</li>
