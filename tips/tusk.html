		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range
				Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.</li>
			<li>With good timing and fancy footwork, <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunami643/status/871767424068177920">you
				can end up in front of your Ice Shards when trying to escape.</a></li>
			<li>The Ice Shards projectile provides flying vision as it travels. The vision remains for 2 seconds once they
				reach their destination.</li>
			<li>Thus, you can use the Shards to help get vision of a neutral creep in the jungle to Snowball to if you're
				getting ganked and there are no good targets nearby.</li>
			<li>You, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable when rolling in a Snowball. This means
				that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.</li>
			<li>You can cast Shards and Sigil while you're in the Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can pick up new heroes while you're rolling mid-Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can load the Sigil into your Snowball.</li>
			<li>The Sigil gives flying vision. Just don't feed it, because it's worth a fair amount of gold.</li>
			<li>Walrus Punch breaks channels, even if the enemy is spell immune.</li>
			<li>You can Walrus Punch the courier.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in
				your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't
				seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.</li>
			<li>Tusk and all his allies are invincible in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks
				apart.</li>
			<li>Tusk can't cast Snowball when rooted.</li>
		</ul>
