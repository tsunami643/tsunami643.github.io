		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Because you don't have mana thanks to your Blood Magic innate, certain spells work weird on you. For example, Clockwerk's
				Power Cogs won't touch you, Lion can't Mana Drain you, and Nyx Assassin can't target you with Mind Flare.
				<ul><li>You technically still have "mana" as shown by your INT value if you hover over your stats. For the purposes of
					spells that do math with your mana, you're effectively always at that max mana value.</li></ul>
			<li>Inner Fire is not a stun and does not cancel channels, it just applies knockback on enemies.
				<ul><li>However, the knockback mechanic does <i>move</i> enemies, making it cancel things like Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive,
					Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Techies' Blast Off, and Templar Assassin's Meld.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Inner Fire gives you the full hero heal value on illusions.</li>
			<li>You can cast spells (like Inner Fire) or items while mid-flight during Life Break.</li>
			<li>Manually casting Burning Spears on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.</li>
			<li>If you level up Burning Spears but keep building an old Spear stack debuff on an enemy, it'll continue using
				the lower level spell values until the debuff times out.</li>
			<li>Burning Spears can't be dispelled.</li>
			<li>Life Break dispels yourself on cast.</li>
			<li>Huskar is debuff immune while flying in Life Break.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Life Break can taunt enemies through debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>Turn on your Armlet <i>after</i> you Life Break, not before, to lose less HP. If you intentionally want less HP,
				do the opposite.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S9O1QbNuws">There is a guaranteed reliable way to take Rosh
				safely with just an Armlet</a> no matter how bad your Rosh bash RNG is. Every time your Armlet is off cooldown,
				toggle it immediately after Rosh lands an attack and you should always be able to survive.</li>
			<li>You can toggle your Armlet while TPing.</li>
			<li>Remember to turn on Armlet before picking up Shield or Illusion runes.</li>
			<li>There is a way to <i>perfectly</i> toggle Armlet on and off on the server same tick. Basically, whichever item slot you want to use for Armlet,
				assign it a quickcast hotkey too. Then mash both hotkeys at the same time to get an instant toggle.
				<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSAtqldtIiQ">Here's a video explaining how to set it up.</a>
					You first need to go to Settings -> To Advanced Hotkeys and toggle the "Enable Advanced Quickcast/Autocast Hotkeys"
					option on to allow setting separate hotkeys for quickcast. Then follow the video's instructions.</li>
					<li>To make this trick extra safe, you can also consider adding your Magic Wand hotkey to the mash for the heal.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember, none of Huskar's spells can cancel TPs. If you see this roided up madman leaping towards you, just start
				TPing out.</li>
			<li>Burning Spears can't be dispelled.</li>
			<li>Life Break dispels Huskar on cast.</li>
			<li>Spell reflection from Lotus Orb will reflect Life Break on Huskar's impact, not on the Life Break cast.</li>
			<li>You can Break Huskar's Berserker's Blood passive.
			<ul>
				<li>Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include
			Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Shard Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike,
			and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/index.php?title=Restoration_Manipulation#Restoration_Classification">a few others.</a></li>
				<li>Viper is especially good at dealing with Huskar since his Corrosive Skin also loves Burning Spears.</li></ul>
			<li>The HP regen Huskar gains from his Berserker's Blood passive can be reduced by heal manipulation debuffs:
				<ul><li>Items that can reduce all heals: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the "Crippling Crossbow" neutral item artifact.</li>
					<li>Be aware that Life Break dispels Huskar on cast, so only use a Vessel charge on him <i>after</i> he activates Life Break.</li>
					<li><span class="facet"></span>His "Cauterize" facet also provides a basic dispel when activating Berserker's Blood.</li>
					<li>Spells that can reduce all heals: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's "Frost Dragon" facet, Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia,
						and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/index.php?title=Restoration_Manipulation#Restoration_Classification">a few others.</a></li>
					<li>Spells that can <i>only</i> reduce HP regen (like from Berserker's Blood), but not other types of heals: Broodmother's Webs with the "Necrotic Webs" facet.</li>
				</ul>
