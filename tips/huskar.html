		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Inner Vitality can be cast on allies and has a fairly low cooldown for the amount that it heals. Cast it
				on your friendly neighborhood support after a team fight to make their life much easier. Or if you're
				falling behind in a game and are no longer the primary damage dealer, cast it on your team's carry.</li>
			<li>It can be difficult to get yourself to low HPs on demand, especially once you get lifesteal. Life Break
				creeps to burn off HP if necessary.</li>
			<li>Turn on your Armlet AFTER you Life Break, not before.</li>
			<li>On the other hand turn on your BKB BEFORE you Life Break so as to not take the self-damage (works with
				Omni Repel as well).</li>
			<li>Life Break dispels yourself on cast. If people are getting items like Heaven's Halberd or Silver Edge
				for you, save the Life Break for dispelling purposes, rather than initiating.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You really need some form of pure damage or solid physical damage if you're planning on dealing with
				Huskar. Berserker's Blood gives him stupid high levels of magic resistance. Timbersaw is probably the
				ideal counter. Other good heroes would be OD, Silencer, Tinker, Bane.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail also deals pure damage.</li>
			<li>Even though he's mostly magic damage, Ancient Apparition can make life hard for Huskars since Ice Blast
				prevents Inner Vitality and lifesteal from healing and because Huskar gets very close to Shatter-range
				when he wants to max out Berserker's Blood.</li>
			<li>Know what you're getting yourself into if you're trying to gank Huskar. Dude thrives on people not
				checking themselves and subsequently wrecking themselves.</li>
