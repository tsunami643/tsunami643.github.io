		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you select your Disruption illusions you can see how the enemy is skilling themselves since your
				illusions' skill points will mirror the enemy's.</li>
			<li>There are pretty much only three reasons why you should ever Disrupt an ally to save them. Either you're
				trying to burn off a 2.75 seconds of a disable they're in, you're helping them stop take damage until their
				Blink Dagger comes off cooldown, or they're about to die and you're using it like
				a Shallow Grave. For slows, blinds, silences, or disarms, unless you're communicating with your allies,
				avoid Disrupting them. 9 times out of 10, people will get mad at you even if they were dead anyway.</li>
			<li>However, there are plenty of occasions to use Disruption on allies in other situations. During
				tower pushes, make more Lunas for maximum glaives. During defenses, make fake Batriders and send one in.
				When warding, make more yous to bait a gank attempt.</li>
			<li>Disruption banishes a target for 2.75 seconds. Blink Dagger's damage cooldown is 3 seconds. Cast a Shadow
				Poison while a target is Disrupted to keep their Blink Dagger on cooldown. You don't even need to use
				the Detonate because the impact damage from the Shadow Poison will disable Blink Dagger and then they'll
				immediately take damage from the illusions afterwards.</li>
			<li>Soul Catcher doesn't work on Roshan or ancient creeps.</li>
			<li>Soul Catcher damage doesn't disable Blink Dagger or interact with other on-damage effects (Blade Mail Return, Tidehunter Kraken Shell,
				dispelling consumable regen, Warlock Fatal Bonds, etc.)</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost.</li>
			<li>With practice, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/aqy9ji/stacking_all_6_dire_top_camps_at_once_shadow_demon/">
				you can stack multiple camps at once.</a></li>
			<li>Stacking camps is useful with Shadow Demon because he's actually great at taking stacks himself with
				Shadow Poison. Once maxed, it takes 6 stacks of Shadow Poison to kill any camp, or 7 if you want to play it safe with
				magic resistance aura creeps. Even less if you use it in conjunction with Soul Catcher.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison is a great spell to draw creep aggro off a tower during defenses.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison's projectile gives flying vision as it travels.</li>
			<li>Demonic Purge is a constant dispel that can go through spell immunity. Here are a few choice applications of this rare interaction:
				<ul>
					<li>Slow and purge spell immune enemies. That one's obvious.</li>
					<li>Target and bring down enemies who are cycloned from their own Eul's Scepter. Will also instantly cancel any self-Eul's
						the enemy casts while Demonically Purged.</li>
					<li>Constantly purge off dispellable buff abilities like Storm Spirit's Overload or Outworld Devourer's Equilibrium.</li>
					<li>Insta-purge off things that can save enemies like: Ghost Scepter, Glimmer Cape, Crimson Guard, Satanic's Unholy Rage,
						Aeon Disk's Combo Breaker (the Combo Breaker hard dispel will still go off, but the no-damage grace period is dispellable).
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Demonic Purge can slow enemy couriers.</li>
			<li>Agh's upgraded Demonic Purge <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Break#Disabled_by_Break">Breaks</a> passive abilities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Because Disruption illusions spawn one "tick" after a real hero emerges from the banish, you can attack+move the ground right before
				a Disruption ends and you'll always start attacking the real hero (assuming no other targets are closer to draw your attack+move aggro).</li>
			<li>If you want to avoid giving item auras (like Radiance) to Disruption illusions, you can hit the toggle while
				you're banished and your illusions will spawn with them off. For next level plays, shift+queue the second toggle
				and you'll immediately get your aura back and SD's illusions won't have it.</li>
			<li>Get a Magic Stick if he's spamming Shadow Poison. Just remember that you only get stick charges on spells
				cast in a 1200 radius <i>if</i> the enemy is in vision.</li>
			<li>Shadow Poison stacks and Soul Catcher's delayed HP restoration can be purged by any type of dispel, weak or strong.</li>
			<li>The only reason Shadow Poison is balanced is because the projectile is very easy to dodge. Don't get
				lazy. You won't see a fat 4 above your head, but you can look in your status bar to see how many stacks
				are on you. If you've bumbled your way into 3 stacks, back off.</li>
