		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can cast Dispose on an ally's topbar portrait to easily target them. Useful if you're trying to save
				a specific target in a sea of summons or illusions in a chaotic teamfight.</li>
			<li>If an ally or enemy is affected by <a href="http://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_Movement">forced movement</a>
				while flying in Dispose, they'll immediately drop to the ground and slow the AoE underneath them.</li>
			<li>You can use Dispose to cancel an enemy's channel because the throw counts as a stun.</li>
			<ul><li>Dispose will also cancel ally channels.</li></ul>
			<li>Dispose throw distance is slightly affected by the z-axis of the map. If you throw a unit uphill, they may not go as far, and if you
				throw a unit downhill, they'll go slightly further than a ground level Dispose.</li>
			<li>When farming lanes, ranged creeps are your best friends. If you have the mana, Rebound off your ranged creep into the enemy wave,
				then chuck the enemy ranged in with Dispose to quickly nuke a wave down.</li>
			<li>Dispose destroys trees wherever the target unit lands.</li>
			<li>Rebound destroys trees wherever you land.</li>
			<li>Your Rebound landing location is not perfectly in the center of the target AoE, but instead slightly closer to the direction you leapt from.
				Ideally, if you're trying to Dispose an enemy into your team after Rebounding, you may want to catch the enemy with the edge of the Rebound AoE
				so you have a good Dispose angle immediately after landing.</li>
			<li>Respect the z-axis when casting Rebound. If your Rebound trajectory arcs over a cliff, you may end up landing on the
				cliff instead of your targeted AoE.</li>
			<li>Always be on the lookout for allies to Rebound off of when you're trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Even if the targeted unit you're Rebounding to dies mid-dash, you'll still leap off their corpse. Very metal.</li>
			<li>Be aware that allies can disjoint Rebound's initial dash. You'll run to wherever they were before they
				disjointed your Rebound and then suddenly stop. So warn them if they're thinking about blinking or activating a Manta Style.</li>
			<li>Rebound's initial dash is stopped by <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Trap#Barriers">barriers</a>, like Disruptor's
				Kinetic Field, but the leap can get you out.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can't cast Rebound when rooted/leashed, but with Agh's Shard you can Rebound allies who are rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Sidekick can be cast on <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Creep-heroes">creep-heroes</a> like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's
				Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.</li>
			<li>Sidekick damage works on denying attacks, but you don't get any lifesteal.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Sidekick Spell Immunity" talent only applies a basic dispel on you and your ally on cast, not a strong dispel.</li>
			<li>Enemies cannot see pulses if your hero is in fog.</li>
			<li>You can continue Unleash combos and get pulses on deny attacks.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This is extremely situational, but in theory you could plant a ward and immediately deny combo it to get a pulse.
				Potentially useful against ethereal, invisible, or fogged units or to maybe cancel a Blink Dagger.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Unleash allows Marci's abilities to create pulses when Unleash is active.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Dispose releases a pulse at the target's location upon landing.</li>
				<li>Rebound releases a pulse at Marci's location upon landing.</li>
				<li>Sidekick releases a pulse at Marci's and the ally's location on cast.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Respect Dispose in lane. Marci's are always fishing for opportunities to yeet you into their tower.</li>
			<li>Roots/leashes prevent Marci from casting Rebound.</li>
			<li>The only thing that can cancel a Rebound <i>that's already mid-cast</i> are sources of <a href="http://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_Movement">forced movement</a>.
				Otherwise, she'll receive whatever stun/root/silence/taunt you put on her, but continue dashing and leaping.</li>
			<li>Sidekick can be purged off enemies.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter and banishes can be useful at wasting her time while she's Unleashed.</li>
