		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be checking your enemy's mana. If they've been blowing spells left and right to try to farm your
				Spiders, they're leaving themselves vulnerable for an easy kill.</li>
			<li>You get new Spiderites on Spiderling denies. Heck, you don't even need to get the deny, just poke an allied
				creep (including your own spiders) with a Spiderling and have them die within 2 seconds with the Spawn
				Spiderite debuff. Boom, free Spiderites.</li>
			<li>In lane, time your Spider harass with enemy last hits. They'll either stay still to get the last hit
				allowing your Spiders to get free harass or they'll run off and miss the last hit.</li>
			<li>Spiders can also be used to block or stack camps.</li>
			<li>Spiders are also useful for cutting off creeps. Send a pile of Spiders behind an enemy tower to mess
				with the creep equilibrium by luring them into the jungle.</li>
			<li>If you're freefarming your legs off, send some Spiders to patrol nearby areas to scout enemies trying
				to gank you.</li>
			<li>Webs have a global cast range as long as the new one you're casting is touching an old one.</li>
			<li>You can destroy specific Webs by selecting them and casting their Destroy Spin Web ability. Otherwise casting
				new Webs past the cap will always destroy the oldest Web.</li>
			<li>You can try destroying a Web after your Spiders converge on a target. This makes your Spiders suddenly have
				collision again instead of being phased, allowing you to use them to body block.</li>
			<li>Shove yourself into the back corner of jungle camps when farming neutrals. This allows you the quickest escape to
				path yourself down a cliff or behind the trees if an enemy spots you and tries to smash you with a newspaper.</li>
			<li>Broodmother illusions will have Incapacitating Bite.</li>
			<li>You can crit off of the bonus damage from Insatiable Hunger.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their spiders off as soon as
				they see Keeper of the Light trot into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be
				making that paper.</li>
			<li>Some heroes that Brood hates going up against in lane:
				<ul><li><b>Axe</b> - Hard to kill in lane, makes life difficult when pushing with Blink+Call.
				<li><b>Batrider</b> - Sticky Napalm and Firefly eat you and your spiders alive.
				<li><b>Bristleback</b> - Quill Spray farms your Spiders easily and he's hard to kill.
				<li><b>Centaur Warrunner</b> - Retaliate makes him difficult to harass with spiders.
				<li><b>Dark Seer</b> - Ion Shell is irritating to deal with and he has high armor.
				<li><b>Kunkka</b> - Tidebringer shreds your spiders and you can't easily escape from his X-Torrent-Boat combo.
				<li><b>Legion Commander</b> - Overwhelming Odds obliterates Brood's entire army from a mile away and she'll have a chance
				to proc Moment of Courage off every spider.
				<li><b>Storm Spirit</b> - Has high natural armor and Static Remnant is cheap enough to spam against Spiders.
				<li><b>Tidehunter</b> - Anchor Smash is tough to deal with and he's crazy tanky.
				<li><b>Timbersaw</b> - Difficult to kill with Reactive Armor, has tons of AoE to kill Spiders.
