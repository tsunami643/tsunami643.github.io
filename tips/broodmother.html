		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>To benefit from Broodmother's Spider's Milk innate, Brood herself has to kill the unit. If your Spiders get the last hit,
				you won't get the heals.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>The "Necrotic Webs" facet reduces Health Restoration on enemies similar to how a Spirit Vessel does if they're standing
				in a web network that Broodmother is also standing in.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Spinner's Snare has global cast range as long as it's within 800 range of a Spin Web.</li>
			<li>You can destroy specific Webs by selecting them and casting their Destroy Spin Web ability. Otherwise, casting
				new Webs past the cap will always destroy the oldest Web.</li>
			<li>Shove yourself into the back corner of jungle camps when farming neutrals. This allows you the quickest escape to
				path yourself down a cliff or behind the trees if an enemy spots you and tries to smash you with a newspaper.</li>
			<li>Multiple casts of Spawn Spiderlings on a single target stack. So you'll get more spiders on a target's death if
				they have several Spawn Spiderling debuffs on them.</li>
			<li>You can try destroying a Web after your Spiders converge on a target. This makes your Spiders suddenly have
				collision again instead of being phased, allowing you to use them to body block.</li>
			<li>You get new Spiderlings on Spiderling denies. Heck, you don't even need to get the deny, just poke an allied
				creep (including your own Spiders) with a Spiderling and have them die with the Spawn
				Spiderling debuff. Infinite Spiderling hack.</li>
			<li>Spiders can be used to block or stack camps.</li>
			<li>If you're freefarming your legs off, send some Spiders to patrol nearby areas to scout enemies trying
				to gank you.</li>
			<li>I highly recommend disabling the "Smart Selection Groups" option in the settings if you're playing Broodmother or
				any micro heroes. This allows you to individually tab through each unit, rather than selecting them as an entire
				group. It makes it much easier to send individual Spiders out on solo missions.
				<ul><li>If you want to send a command to all the Spiders, you can always just double click on a single
					Spiderling and it'll select them all. Or use the "Unified Orders with CTRL" option in settings.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their Spiders off as soon as
				they see Keeper of the Light trot into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be
				making that paper.</li>
			<li>Some heroes that Brood's spiders don't really bother:
				<ul><li><b>Axe</b> - Makes life difficult with Counter Helix and Berserker's Call.
				<li><b>Batrider</b> - Sticky Napalm and Firefly eat you and your Spiders alive.
				<li><b>Bristleback</b> - Quill Spray farms your Spiders easily and he's hard to kill.
				<li><b>Centaur Warrunner</b> - Retaliate makes him difficult to harass with Spiders.
				<li><b>Dark Seer</b> - Ion Shell is irritating to deal with and he has high armor.
				<li><b>Dragon Knight</b> - Spiders barely scratch DK with Dragon Blood armor and Breathe Fire will incinerate them.</li>
				<li><b>Earthshaker</b> - Can easily farm Spiders from a distance and can Echo Slam Brood into kingdom come if she's bunched up with them.</li>
				<li><b>Grimstroke</b> - Stroke of Fate can instagib an entire Spider army and maybe even Broodmother herself with the
					stacking damage.</li>
				<li><b>Kunkka</b> - Tidebringer shreds your Spiders and you can't easily escape from his X-Torrent-Boat combo.
				<li><b>Legion Commander</b> - Overwhelming Odds obliterates Brood's entire army from a mile away and she'll have a chance
				to proc Moment of Courage off every Spider.
				<li><b>Mars</b> - His entire spell kit makes life miserable for Brood.
				<li><b>Storm Spirit</b> - Has high natural armor and Static Remnant is cheap enough to spam against Spiders.
				<li><b>Tidehunter</b> - Anchor Smash is tough to deal with and he's crazy tanky.
				<li><b>Timbersaw</b> - Difficult to kill with Reactive Armor, has tons of AoE to kill Spiders.
			</ul>
			<li>The lifesteal Broodmother gains from Insatiable Hunger can be reduced by debuffs that affect Health Restoration:
				<ul><li>Items that can reduce health restoration: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the "Crippling Crossbow" and "Jidi Pollen Bag" neutral item artifacts.</li>
					<li>Spells that can reduce health restoration: Abaddon's Withering Mist innate, Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Broodmother's Spin Webs with "Necrotic Webs" facet, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's "Frost Dragon" facet,
						Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, Slark's Saltwater Shiv, and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/index.php?title=Restoration_Manipulation#Restoration_Classification">a few others.</a></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Ghost Scepter can buy you a few valuable seconds of not getting eaten alive by spiders.</li>
