		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can crit off of the bonus damage from Insatiable Hunger.</li>
			<li>Webs have a global cast range as long as the new one you're casting is touching an old one.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Spinner's Snare has global cast range as long as it's touching a Spin Web.</li>
			<li>You can destroy specific Webs by selecting them and casting their Destroy Spin Web ability. Otherwise casting
				new Webs past the cap will always destroy the oldest Web.</li>
			<li>Shove yourself into the back corner of jungle camps when farming neutrals. This allows you the quickest escape to
				path yourself down a cliff or behind the trees if an enemy spots you and tries to smash you with a newspaper.</li>
			<li>In the offlanes, there's a small unpathable area where you can see the river extending 'underneath' the lane. You can draw
				creep aggro and then Web yourself into the river extension and the creeps won't be able to path to you. They'll just hang out on the edge
				and stare at you. Could be useful for resetting lane equilibrium.
			</li>
			<li>Multiple casts of Spawn Spiderlings on a single target stack. So you'll get more spiders on a target's death if
				they have several Spawn Spiderling debuffs on them.</li>
			<li>You can try destroying a Web after your Spiders converge on a target. This makes your Spiders suddenly have
				collision again instead of being phased, allowing you to use them to body block.</li>
			<li>You get new Spiderites on Spiderling denies. Heck, you don't even need to get the deny, just poke an allied
				creep (including your own Spiders) with a Spiderling and have them die with the Spawn
				Spiderite debuff. Boom, free Spiderites.</li>
			<li>Spiders can be used to block or stack camps.</li>
			<li>If you're freefarming your legs off, send some Spiders to patrol nearby areas to scout enemies trying
				to gank you.</li>
			<li>I highly recommend enabling the console command <font face="courier new">dota_selection_groups false</font> if you're playing
				Broodmother or any micro heroes. This allows you to individually tab through each unit, rather than selecting the entire
				group of units. It makes it much easier to send individual Spiders out on solo missions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their Spiders off as soon as
				they see Keeper of the Light trot into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be
				making that paper.</li>
			<li>Some heroes that Brood's spiders don't really bother:
				<ul><li><b>Axe</b> - Makes life difficult with Counter Helix and Berserker's Call.
				<li><b>Batrider</b> - Sticky Napalm and Firefly eat you and your Spiders alive.
				<li><b>Bristleback</b> - Quill Spray farms your Spiders easily and he's hard to kill.
				<li><b>Mars</b> - His entire spell kit makes life miserable for Brood.</li>
				<li><b>Centaur Warrunner</b> - Retaliate makes him difficult to harass with Spiders.
				<li><b>Dark Seer</b> - Ion Shell is irritating to deal with and he has high armor.
				<li><b>Dragon Knight</b> - Spiders barely scratch DK with Dragon Blood armor and Breathe Fire will incinerate them.</li>
				<li><b>Grimstroke</b> - Stroke of Fate can instagib an entire Spider army and maybe even Broodmother herself with the
					stacking damage.</li>
				<li><b>Kunkka</b> - Tidebringer shreds your Spiders and you can't easily escape from his X-Torrent-Boat combo.
				<li><b>Legion Commander</b> - Overwhelming Odds obliterates Brood's entire army from a mile away and she'll have a chance
				to proc Moment of Courage off every Spider.
				<li><b>Storm Spirit</b> - Has high natural armor and Static Remnant is cheap enough to spam against Spiders.
				<li><b>Tidehunter</b> - Anchor Smash is tough to deal with and he's crazy tanky.
				<li><b>Timbersaw</b> - Difficult to kill with Reactive Armor, has tons of AoE to kill Spiders.
			</ul>
			<li>Spirit Vessel, Skadi, and Shiva's heal reduction aspects can reduce the amount of HP she'll gain from Insatiable Hunger.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter can buy you a few valuable seconds of not getting eaten alive by spiders.</li>
