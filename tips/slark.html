		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dark Pact is a 'nuke' like Lifestealer's Infest can be a 'nuke.' Yes, the spell can deal healthy damage,
				but that's not its primary purpose. Don't yank the Pact ripcord the second you get in melee range of
				your gank target. Wait for them to turn around, or for their teammate to come in to save them, then pull
				the trigger and wipe off any potential disable. If you need to use Dark Pact for damage, only use it if
				you're sure the enemy can't stop you or try to save it for the killing blow.</li>

																														 Pact
					<b><i>can't</b></i> purge a lot of things.</a> The ones worth remembering from this list are Ancient
																   Apparition's Ice Blast, Bloodseeker's Rupture, Bane's
																   Enfeeble, Witch Doctor's Maledict, Razor's Static
																   Link, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike, or
																   Warlock's Fatal Bonds or Shadow Word. If you want to
																   get rid of these spells, too bad.</li>
			<li>Medallion/Solar Crest is a cute pickup on Slark because Dark Pact can purge the negative armor debuff
				off yourself after you cast it on an enemy.</li>
			<li>Pounce won't latch illusions, making it useful for identifying the real CK/PL/Waifu Siren.</li>
			<li>Pounce can hit invisible units.</li>
			<li>Pounce disjoints stuff like tower shots or ranged right clicks. If you time it right you can even evade
				projectile spells like Assassinate.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of your collisionless state in Pounce when you're escaping. Don't just leap along down
				the lane, jump over a tree line or clear a cliff to create a gap.</li>
			<li>Essence Shift gifts you with a bonus 19 'pure damage' (with the STR removal), 13 'mana burn' (with the
				INT removal), and sucks off 1 damage from the enemy (with their primary attribute's removal).</li>
			<li>Capitalize on Essence Shift stacks. Don't sit around and farm after you get a kill, take a tower or TP
				to another lane and use all the damage you have to continue snowballing.</li>
			<li>Shadow Dance is an extremely effective spell for counterwarding. The moment you stop dripping and slow
				down, you're in enemy vision and the Shadow Dance passive is lost.</li>
			<li>Slark is one of few heroes that has 1800 night vision.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dark Pact purges as often as it damages, meaning that there are 10 little mini-purges throughout the
				duration of the spell. So don't stun Slark mid-Pact.</li>
			<li>Ground targeted spells (especially stuns like LSA, Split Earth, Impale, etc.) are highly valuable
				against Slark for hassling him whenever he activates Shadow Dance.</li>
			<li>Inexperienced Slarks have a tendency of going for long-range Pounces which are fairly easy to juke. Line
				yourself up with him when you're getting chased to tease the Pounce out, then move straight left or
				right and dodge it.</li>
			<li>Try to block Pounce by standing in front of Slark if he's trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Essence Shift is the long con. You may think you're winning these exchanges in lane because Slark has
				awful HP, but he's gaining a Slipper of Agility and you're losing an Iron Branch's worth of stats every
				time you trade hits.</li>
			<li>You'll get your Essence Shifted stats back when you respawn, but Slark will still have them as well. If
				Slark dies, you'll still be missing your stats, but he'll lose them as well.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter isn't as useful against Slark as it is against some other gankers since Pounce and Pact
				can deal substantial magical damage, but it can still be a worthwhile pickup.</li>
			<li>He has no means of breaking channels. If Slark is hot on your tail, just start TPing.</li>
			<li>Bloodseeker notably counters the dickens out of Slark. Slark doesn't like to be silenced, he can't Dark
				Pact off Rupture, and if he loses too much HP he'll make BS Thirsty and give him true sight, stopping
				him from getting Shadow Dance regen.</li>
			<li>Spirit Breaker is also irritating for Slark to deal with since Dark Pact can't purge off Charge and
				since Charge will provide vision the whole time, Slark can't regen unless he activates Shadow Dance.</li>
