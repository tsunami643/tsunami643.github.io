		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dark Pact is a 'nuke' like Lifestealer's Infest can be a 'nuke.' Yes, the spell can deal healthy damage,
				but that's not its only purpose. Don't yank the Pact ripcord the second you get in melee range of
				your gank target. Wait for them to turn around, or for their teammate to come in to save them, then pull
				the trigger and wipe off any potential disable. If you need to use Dark Pact for damage, only use it if
				you're sure the enemy can't stop you or try to save it for the killing blow.</li>
			<li>
				<a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">
				Dark Pact <b><i>can't</i></b> purge a lot of things despite being a 'strong' dispel.</a> The ones worth remembering
				from this list are Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Bloodseeker's Rupture, Invoker's Deafening Blast,
				Witch Doctor's Maledict, Razor's Static Link, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike, or Halberd disarm. If you want to get
				rid of these spells, too bad.</li>
			<li>Pounce won't latch illusions, making it useful for identifying the real CK/PL/Naga Siren.</li>
			<li>Pounce can hit invisible units.</li>
			<li>Leashing enemies with Pounce will cancel their TPs and prevent them from TPing while leashed.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of your free pathing state in Pounce when you're escaping. Don't just leap along down
				the lane, jump over a tree line or clear a cliff to create a gap.</li>
			<li>Essence Shift gifts you with a bonus 'pure damage' (with the STR removal), 'mana burn' (with the
				INT removal), and sucks off 1 damage from the enemy (with their primary attribute's removal).</li>
			<li>Capitalize on Essence Shift stacks. Don't sit around and farm after you get a kill, take a tower or TP
				to another lane and use all the damage you have to continue snowballing.</li>
			<li>You will lose all Essence Shift stacks on death, including deaths from Aegis. The enemies will still be missing
				their stats for the full duration, however.</li>
			<li>You need to be within 300 range of a target dying with the Essence Shift debuff to get the permanent AGI. Or if you
				get the kill credit, the enemy can be at any range.</li>
			<li>Shadow Dance is an extremely effective spell for counterwarding. The moment you stop dripping and slow
				down, you're in enemy vision and the Shadow Dance passive is lost.</li>
			<li>Enemies can still see the TP particle effect when you start channeling under Shadow Dance.</li>
			<li>Slark is one of few heroes that has 1800 night vision.</li>
			<li>If you have slots to burn late game for some reason, an interaction worth noting is that Skadi's slow
				fully stacks with Orb of Venom's slow.</li>
			<li>You can't cast Shadow Dance while channeling a TP unlike other invis spells, but you can use Shadow Blade or
				Shadow Amulet mid-channel.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dark Pact purges as often as it damages, meaning that there are 10 little mini-purges throughout the
				duration of the spell. So don't stun Slark mid-Pact.</li>
			<li>Dark Pact can't purge off Halberd's disarm.</li>
			<li>Ground targeted spells (especially stuns like Lina's LSA, Leshrac's Split Earth, Nyx's Impale, etc.) are highly valuable
				against Slark for hassling him whenever he activates Shadow Dance.</li>
			<li>Inexperienced Slarks have a tendency of going for long-range Pounces which are fairly easy to juke. Line
				yourself up with him when you're getting chased to tease the Pounce out, then move straight left or
				right and dodge it.</li>
			<li>Leashes, like roots, <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Leash#Disabled_by_leashes">disable usage of movement spells.</a></li>
			<li>If you manage to move your hero outside the edge of the Pounce leash, it'll break. That means weird things
				that provide collision, like planting an Iron Branch or getting shoved by an Earthshaker Fissure or Tusk Ice Shards
				will break the leash. So do other repositioning spells, like getting kicked by an Earth Spirit Boulder Smash, getting
				Hooked by Pudge, or even a lucky Manta Style rearrangement.</li>
			<li>If you go for the Manta Style method, your best bet is to activate Phase Boots before Mirror Image to reduce your chances
				of collision with an illusion pushing you back into the leash.</li>
			<li>If you go for the Branch planting method, casting the Branch on your portrait is surprisingly reliable at breaking out of
				a Pounce leash.</li>
			<li>You can Force Staff out of Slark's Pounce leash.</li>
			<li>Spell immunity removes Slark's Pounce leash.</li>
			<li>Try to block Pounce by standing in front of Slark if he's trying to escape.</li>
			<li>Slark cannot Pounce when rooted.</li>
			<li>Essence Shift is the long con. You may think you're winning these exchanges in lane because Slark has
				awful HP, but he's gaining a Slipper of Agility and you're losing an Iron Branch's worth of stats every
				time you trade hits.</li>
			<li>You'll get your Essence Shifted stats back when you respawn, but Slark will still have them as well.
				This is true for Aegis deaths as well.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter can help supports survive Slark ganks.</li>
			<li>Bloodseeker notably counters the dickens out of Slark. Slark doesn't like to be silenced, he can't Dark
				Pact off Rupture, and if he loses too much HP he'll make BS Thirsty and give him global true sight, thus preventing
				Shadow Dance regen.</li>
			<li>Spirit Breaker is also irritating for Slark to deal with since Dark Pact can't purge off Charge and
				since Charge will provide vision the whole time, Slark can't regen unless he activates Shadow Dance.</li>
			<li>Slark can't purge Disruptor's Glimpse, making Glimpse into Static Storm+Kinetic Field often lethal.</li>
			<li>Naga's Song turns off Slark's Shadow Dance active and reveals him, thus stopping Slark from regening and being
				invisible. The Dance will continue once the Song ends, though.</li>
