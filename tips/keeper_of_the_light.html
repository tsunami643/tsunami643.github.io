		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Stop channeling Illuminate in the middle of the lane. Keeper works best as a creepy old hero molester
				hiding in the trees gently stroking his staff, waiting to explode.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid to terminate an Illuminate early if people are moving away. The horses have a travel
				time and a small amount of assured damage can sometimes be better than a huge amount of unreliable
				damage.</li>
			<li>Learn where the creeps should be according to what the time is to get the most out of Illuminate. The
				easiest way to do this is to look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where those creeps
				are.</li>
			<li>Don't randomly channel Illuminate when pushing into T3s just because it's off cooldown. Start it
				at X:27/X:57 to kill the upcoming creep wave.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to maximize your Chakra usage, try to get as little INT on a hero before you Chakra
				them. Tell allies to Tread switch or put their Arcane Boots or Bloodstone in their backpack. It's the same concept as
				shedding STR before you heal, yet used much less frequently.</li>
			<li>Chakra Magic's cooldown reduction even works on passives, such as Kunkka's Tidebringer or the Spirit Bear's
				Entangling Claws.</li>
			<li>Blinding Light won't stop channels even though it bounces enemies. You can use it if it makes you feel
				better, but Tinker is still going to TP out before you can kill him.</li>
			<li>When escaping a gank, cast Blinding Light in front of yourself, instead of behind. Keeper will
				have to turn around to cast it if you target it behind you.</li>
			<li>Will-O-Wisp destroys trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees
				during a chase, or stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King.</li>
			<li>The first Will-O-Wisp pulse happens one second after the spell is cast.</li>
			<li>Will-O-Wisp's hypnotize can break enemy channels.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Keep your lane warded up tight if you're against KotL to keep eyes on when and where he's Illuminating.
				You'll save the money you would have spent on regen with your wards.</li>
			<li>Don't underestimate Blinding Light. If you're a right clicker, this skill will destroy you. Get a BKB or
				Manta if you're a carry and the enemy team has a KotL solely because of this skill.</li>
			<li>If think your team will have trouble pushing high ground against KotL, consider building a Pipe.</li>
			<li>Please kill the Will-O-Wisp. It doesn't take many attacks and it has a significant gold bounty for your
				troubles. Just be sure to spam right click on it. After you get Hypnotized, your attack command
				will be forgotten and your hero will just move to attack the next nearest target.</li>
