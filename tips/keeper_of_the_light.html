		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Stop channeling Illuminate in the middle of the lane. Keeper works best as a creepy voyeur
				hiding in the trees gently stroking his staff, waiting to explode.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid to terminate an Illuminate early if people are moving away. The horses have a travel
				time and a small amount of assured damage can sometimes be better than a huge amount of unreliable
				damage.</li>
			<li>Learn where the creeps should be according to what the time is to get the most out of Illuminate. The
				easiest way to do this is to look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where those creeps
				are.</li>
			<li>Don't randomly channel Illuminate when pushing into tier 3 towers just because it's off cooldown. Start it
				at X:28/X:58 to kill the upcoming creep wave.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the buff timer on Spirit Form. If you were charging an Illuminate up, it'll cancel whenever Spirit Form
				times out.
			</li>
			<li>If you're trying to maximize your Chakra usage, try to get as little INT on a hero before you Chakra
				them.</li>
			<li>Chakra Magic's cooldown reduction even works on passives, such as Kunkka's Tidebringer or the Lone Druid Spirit Bear's
				Entangling Claws.</li>
			<li>Blinding Light won't stop channels even though it bounces enemies.</li>
			<li>If a hero is chasing you in melee range, cast Blinding Light in front of yourself, instead of behind. Keeper will
				have to turn around to cast it if you target it behind you.</li>
			<li>When trying to teleport a teammate in danger with Recall, keep in mind that if they receive any damage from a hero,
				the teleport gets canceled. Wait for your ally to run into the trees or just escape fog before casting the spell on them.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Will-O-Wisp destroys trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Nature's Prophet's Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees
				during a chase, or stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The first Will-O-Wisp pulse happens one second after the spell is cast.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Keep your lane warded up tight if you're against KotL to keep eyes on when and where he's Illuminating.
				You'll save the money you would have spent on regen with your wards.</li>
			<li>Don't underestimate Blinding Light. If you rely on right click attacks in fights, you may need a BKB or Manta Style or Satanic just
				to dispel the miss chance on this spell.</li>
			<li>If think your team will have trouble pushing high ground against KotL, consider building a Pipe.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can select the Will-O-Wisp Ignis Fatuus and alt+click the buff timer to see how many seconds are left.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Clones like Meepo and Arc Warden's Tempest Double count as heroes when attacking the Will-O-Wisp. Illusions
				do not count.</li>
