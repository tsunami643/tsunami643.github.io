		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Illusory Orb is your main escape before you get your Blink Dagger. The second you toss out an Orb to
				damage some creeps, your fairie dragon ass starts looking much tastier to kill. This is most relevant
				when you're in the mid lane and you're trying to push the wave to get the rune. Only use the Orb if
				you're confident that you can't get nuked down in the next ~10s.</li>
			<li>When pushing, cast Illusory Orb from the back of the enemy creep wave towards your creeps or into trees
				and then Jaunt to it. This can help create a buffer from heroes who will try to gank you once they see
				your Orb is down.</li>
			<li>Even when farming, try to put <i>some</i> brainpower into the angle you're casting your Orb. You never know when
				you may suddenly get vision of an enemy and have a chance to Jaunt in or out to escape or get a kill.</li>
			<li>Illusory Orb's projectile gives flying vision. Not only does it give vision around the Orb itself,
				but the vision lingers for a few seconds along its path as well. Use it for scouting, shutting down
				juking, or finishing off couriers.</li>
			<li>There are three main ways to Jaunt the full distance reliably. Either you watch for the Orb to turn red,
				listen to the sound pitch of the Orb, or you can just count to 3.</li>
			<li>When you're on the run, toss an Orb in one direction and continue walking in another direction. If the
				enemies chasing you commit to the Orb, don't Jaunt, if they keep following you, Jaunt.</li>
			<li>Your Illusory Orb remains active even after you die. In very specific situations you can consider buying
				back and immediately Jaunting after you die to return to a fight.</li>
			<li>If Phase Shift is on cooldown, know that Jaunting also disjoints.</li>
			<li>You only need to cast Phase Shift to disjoint things, you don't need to complete the channel. If a tower
				shot is about to hit you, just tap Phase Shift and keep moving.</li>
			<li>If you click in a direction to turn before casting Phase Shift, you'll complete your rotation while in
				Phase Shift. This is similar to the turning before RP'ing trick on Magnus.</li>
			<li>Puck can completely avoid spells like Ice Path and even insta-cast spells like hexes while Phase Shifted
				as long as you Blink in the direction you were facing before you Phase Shifted. If you try to Blink in a
				different direction, you'll get caught due to turn rate after Phase Shift ends.</li>
			<li>Dream Coil leashes enemies, which stops them from using <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Leash#Disabled_by_leashes">most
				movement spells</a> and also prevents them from beginning a TP channel.</li>
			<li>Nothing can stop your "Dream Coil Rapid Fire" talent attacks. As long as you're in range of your targets and
				as long as the leash is applied to them, you will continue attacking through banishes (like Phase Shift or Eul's Cyclone)
				or disarms.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>As soon as the Orb comes out, start looking for the kill. Puck may be hard to lock down, but Orb being
				on cooldown halves this hero's survivability in the early game.</li>
			<li>Illusory Orb travels for 3 seconds. Most stuns last ~2 seconds. Save your stun for around 1 second
				after an enemy Puck tosses out an Orb. If they Jaunt within that second, they didn't get very far anyway
				so whatever.</li>
			<li>Playing against Puck in lane is all about baiting out useless Phase Shifts. Animation canceling is usually
				the easiest way, but smart Pucks ain't about that cancel lyfe and won't get scared by your Magnus
				practicing lacrosse with Shockwave canceling. So just wait for them to use Phase Shift for some other
				reason (tower shots, creep aggro) or try to bait it by tossing out a less important spell (Shadow Strike
				is the textbook example) or an auto-attack.</li>
			<li>Puck can't Phase Shift when rooted, however Jaunting is still possible.</li>
			<li>You can watch the debuff timer of Dream Coil ticking down to know when it's safe to start walking out of it.
				People are always very impressed when you walk out of a Dream Coil right as it's ending, 
				like accelerating your car during a red light when you know it's about to turn green.
			</li>
			<li>Nullifier can purge Eul's Cyclone and subsequently mute any potential Blink Daggers from Puck.</li>
