		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Reflection only catches heroes in vision.</li>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all the auras that normal enemy illusions carry.</li>
			<li>Use Conjure Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes
				in the early game.</li>
			<li>Remember that you lose some movespeed when you're in Metamorphosis.</li>
			<li>If you're planning on getting aggressive in lane soon, it's in your best interest to pre-cast a Conjure Image and
				hide it. 16 seconds later, load up another one and then go in.</li>
			<li>Manta Style has a longer cooldown and weaker illusions for ranged heroes compared to melee heroes. Activate Manta
				<i>before</i> casting Metamorphosis.</li>
			<li>If you are mid-cast animation of Conjure Image as your Metamorphosis times out, your illusion will spawn in Metamorphosis
				form for its duration.</li>
			<li>Sunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta illusions).</li>
			<li>Sunder has a minimum HP transfer of 35/30/25%. So if you and an ally are both under those percentages, Sunder will heal you both.</li>
			<li>You can Sunder through AA's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP.</li>
			<li>You can't Sunder spell immune enemies, but you can Sunder spell immune allies.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes.
				The mana regen from the item is just gravy.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The Reflection slow and illusion can be purged off with basic dispels.</li>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building
				things like Radiance or AC against a TB.</li>
			<li>TB has armor for days, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If
				your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras,
				but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.</li>
			<li>Sunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.</li>
			<li>Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions.</li>
			<li>Illusions created of an enemy Terrorblade will spawn in Metamorphosis form if the hero himself has it activated, but they won't
				transform if TB activates Meta afterwards.</li>
