		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Reflection works on heroes that are in fog, but not invisible heroes.</li>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all the auras that normal enemy illusions carry.</li>
			<li>Use Conjure Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes
				in the early game.</li>
			<li>If you're planning on getting aggressive in lane soon, it's in your best interest to pre-cast a Conjure Image and
				hide it. 16 seconds later, load up another one and then go in.</li>
			<li>Terrorblade illusions can only be in Metamorphosis form if the real hero is within 1200 range of them.</li>
			<li>If you create an illusion on the <i>exact same tick</i> that Metamorphosis times out on your hero, the illusion will spawn
				in Metamorphosis form for its entire duration. This works with Conjure Image and Manta Style illusions.</li>
			<li>Sunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta Style illusions).</li>
			<li>Sunder has a minimum HP transfer percentage. If you and a target are both under the percentage, Sunder will heal you both
				to the minimum.</li>
			<li>You can Sunder through Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP.</li>
			<li>You can't Sunder spell immune enemies, but you can Sunder spell immune allies. Except don't do it. It just puts the spell on cooldown
				and doesn't actually transfer any HP.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes.
				The mana regen from the item is just gravy.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>There is a 0.6s delay when activating Agh's Scepter Terror Wave before the fear actually goes out.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The Reflection slow and illusion can be purged off with basic dispels.</li>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building
				things like Radiance or Assault Cuirass against a TB.</li>
			<li>TB has armor for days, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If
				your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras,
				but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.</li>
			<li>Sunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.</li>
			<li>Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Pugna's Life Drain, Lion's Mana Drain, Disruptor's Glimpse, and any Hex.</li>
			<li>Other heroes with spells that are useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or
				Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.</li>
			<li>Illusions created of an enemy Terrorblade will spawn in Metamorphosis form if the hero himself has it activated, but they won't
				transform if TB activates Meta afterwards. The transformation only works on illusions Terrorblade owns.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Terror Wave fear can be dispelled by basic/weak dispels.</li>
