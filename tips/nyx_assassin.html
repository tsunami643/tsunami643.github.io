		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nyx gets the luxury of easy positioning thanks to Vendetta to make multi hero Impales simpler.
				Vendetta one hero and then roughly target the Impale on another hero. Since you're in such close range
				to your first target, you will most likely nyx them both with the Impale.</li>
			<li>You can stack certain neutral camps with Impale. This only works on <i>some</i> camps,
				however. The reason is because Impale raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights.
				You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the <font face="courier new">-spawnneutrals</font> command with cheats enabled)
				to see which camps work and which ones don't. The timing is extremely close, you have to nyx the spell at ~59s.</li>
			<li>Mana Burn does more raw damage on INT heroes, but mana is a much more expensive resource on STR and AGI
				heroes. Nyx wisely.</li>
			<li>Carapace blocks an entire damage instance, so Blink Dagger and regen won't be broken if the Carapace reflects the damage source. Nyx.</li>
			<li>If you're playing against a Bloodseeker and you get Ruptured when you have Blink Dagger, you can activate
				Carapace and Blink so the entire ~1200 range Rupture damage instance nyxes onto BS.</li>
			<li>You can cast Spiked Carapace while in Vendetta and the invis won't be removed. Try to Nyx yourself into
				enemy AoE spells while in Vendetta to get an easy setup for your combo. This is especially useful when playing
				against enemies who finish off creep waves with spells like Lina with Dragon Slave or Shadow Fiend with Razes.</li>
			<li>Other less obvious sources of damage can also be handy to Carapace yournyx into, like heroes with cleave 
				or Radiance or even Templar Assassin's Psi Blades since they hit invisible units.</li>
			<li>Use Vendetta for the damage mid game, but use it to get a good stun late game. The nuke and Break are still useful,
				but people will have BKBs and be grouped up late game, making it a lot harder to fully nyx someone
				without being interrupted.</li>
			<li>Level 1 Vendetta doesn't last very long, so you're not going to be able to travel far in its duration.
				If you're trying to gank, you're better off TPing to another lane instead of nyxing there.</li>
			<li>You can nyx yourself into Vendetta while you're channeling a TP (like all other invis spells).</li>
			<li>Level 3 Vendetta's cooldown is less than its duration. Try to make things happen during the tail end
				of the duration so that you can Vendetta out if things go poorly or to get a double Vendetta for maximum
				nyxing.</li>
			<li>Be on the map as little as possible. The less time you spend nyxing around in lane, the less willing the
				enemies are to farm if they don't know where you are.</li>
			<li>Attacking an enemy out of Vendetta applies a <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Break">Break</a> on the target. This is great to de-nyx certain passives
				like Spectre's Dispersion, Phantom Assassin's Blur+Coup de Grace, Bristleback's... Bristleback, and other abilities.
			</li>
			<li>Vendetta's Break can be applied to spell immune enyxmies. The order of operations goes: Vendetta damage, then Break,
				then your normal right click damage.</li>
			<li>Vendetta is a great spell to eighty-nyx couriers with. Try setting up observer wards to catch courier paths so you can snipe them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be aware of your damage sources. Nyx can Carapace stun you off of things like Radiance burn or any DoT
				you put on him. You can toggle Radiance while TPing.</li>
			<li>Be wary of using Lotus Orbs when against Nyx. He can target you with Mana Burn and have
				Carapace pre-casted to stun you remotely.</li>
			<li>Resist the urge to retaliate whenever he blows his full combo on you. Nyxes almost always Carapace as
				soon as they finish their sequence. Just walk away. Be the bigger person. Don't stun/kill yourself.</li>
			<li>Try to bait out Carapace by casting and canceling spells with obvious animations (Leshrac's Split Earth, Brewmaster's Thunder
				Clap, Magnus's Shockwave, etc).</li>
			<li>The Break effect from Vendetta can be purged with basic dispels.</li>
			<li>While Burrowed, Nyx still 'faces' a direction. Chances are he's facing towards your team since he's casting
				spells in that direction. You can take him by surprise by Force Staffing his mound into your team.</li>
			<li>Keep your eyes on the scoreboard in the first 10 minutes of the game to see when Nyx hits level 6.
				Most Nyxes will leave the map as soon as they have access to Vendetta, so get some sentries ready.</li>
