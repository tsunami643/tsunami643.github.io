		<h1>Tips</h1>
    	<ul>
			<li>Sticky Bombs will always latch to the nearest hero upon landing.</li>
			<li>Sticky Bombs provide 600 ground vision when they're spinning around or once they attach to an enemy.</li>
			<li>Sticky Bombs destroy trees in a tiny radius around the target point.</li>
			<li>If you're banished while flying in Blast Off, your spell will land with the silence and damage, but you won't take the self-damage.</li>
			<li>Magic resistance can reduce the Blast Off self damage. Eternal Shroud works on self damage and can give you back mana from a Blast Off.</li>
			<li>Respect the z-axis when casting Blast Off. If your Blast Off trajectory arcs over a cliff, you may end up landing on the cliff instead of your
				targeted AoE.</li>
			<li>If you plant a Proximity Mine directly underneath yourself after Blasting Off into some enemies, they may struggle to right click it underneath your
				hero model.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Even more frustrating is if they try to destroy your mine while your Reactive Tazer is on because then they'll also get disarmed for trying.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/an7iw5/there_are_blind_spots_in_rosh_pit_where_you_cant/">There are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the
				Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it.</a> You can use this to potentially hide Proximity Mines.</li>
			<li>There are a few noteworthy areas on the map that you can potentially force an enemy into triggering
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5jddmy/techies_double_proximity_mining_spots/">multiple Proximity Mines
				at the same time.</a> The guide is somewhat outdated, but the principles still apply.</li>
			<li>All placed Proximity Mines will dynamically level up as more points are put into the spell.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines deal damage to buildings. However, remember that Proximity Mines deal less damage the further they are away from the target,
				so try to place Mines as close to the tower as possible.
			</li>
			<li>Towers won't ever attack Proximity Mines.</li>
			<li>Spell damage amplification from items like Kaya do not boost Mine damage since the Mine itself is the source of the damage, not your hero.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of dropping/backpacking INT/mana items to get more effective regen when you use Soul Ring or Arcane Boots.</li>
			<li>You can buy a Void Stone in the secret shop and sell it back before 10 seconds pass to get some free regen. You turn
				the gold unreliable, but Techies benefits a lot from mana regen items, even in short bursts.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Any type of attack that lands on Techies with Reactive Tazer active will disarm you. This includes <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">
				instant attacks</a> from spells. So if a Monkey King Boundless Strikes a Tazer'd Techies, he'll get disarmed. If a Phantom Assassin Stifling
				Dagger's a Tazer'd Techies, she'll get disarmed. If a Medusa Split Shot lands on a Tazer'd Techies... she actually won't get disarmed for some reason.
				She will if she has her "Split Shot Uses Modifiers" talent though. Basically, if the instant attack can also proc attack modifiers, you'll get disarmed. Dota 2, amirite?
				<ul><li>Oh, one more note! If your instant attack also banishes you, like Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist or Riki's Tricks of the Trade, then you won't get disarmed.</li></ul>
			<li>Techies turns brighter and more... electrick-y when Reactive Tazer is about to pop.</li>
			<li>If you purge Reactive Tazer off a Techies, it'll immediately detonate and disarm everything in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Don't listen to music when you're playing against Techies. Proximity Mines make a noise when you walk into the trigger AoE, even through fog.</li>
			<li>Flying units cannot trigger or be damaged by Proximity Mines.</li>
			<li>Invisible units can trigger and be damaged by Proximity Mines.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines are invisible once armed until you walk into their AoE, even Gem/sentry wards can't spot them.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines only take one attack to be destroyed. <b>SO PLEASE. ATTACK. THE MINE.</b> <i>Especially,</i> as a carry. Your
				attack speed is way higher than a support, so you have a much better chance of killing them before they explode.</li>
			<li>Damage absorbed from Proximity Mines during Blade Mail does not reflect onto Techies.</li>
			<li>Attack+moving will <i>not</i> target Proximity Mines. You have to manually right click each one to attack them.</li>
			<li>Stuns and other disables <i>won't</i> stop a Techies that's in flight from a Blast Off, but sources of forced movement can.
				This means cycloning or Force Staffing a Techies that's Blasting Off will cancel the explosion. Weird spells that move the enemy vertically,
				like Sand King's Burrowstrike, Nyx's Impale, Lion's Earth Spike, and Rubick's Telekinesis, or horizontally,
				like Drow Ranger's Gust, Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, and Storm Spirit's Electric Vortex, will also cancel the explosion.</li>
			<li>Techies can do very little when getting Battery Assaulted by a Clockwerk since his cast animations take so long.</li>
			<li>Avoid standing close to treelines when pushing against Techies. It's a favorite area for hidden Mine stashes.</li>
			<li>Techies players loooove going for offensive Force Staff plays, so be very wary if you see that item in his inventory.</li>
			<li>Be very careful when walking up any high ground stairs since there may be a Proximity Mine or two hiding just outside your vision.</li>
			<li>It's important to have ranged heroes against Techies to be able to safely destroy Mines before they explode.</li>
			<li>All of Techies' damage is magical, so items like Glimmer Cape or Pipe can improve your survivability.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrops can give you some very valuable early game survivability against a Techies.</li>
