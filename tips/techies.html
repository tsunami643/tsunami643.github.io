				play Techies are dirty, but there is no quick way. With that in mind, here are a few resources that can help
				jump-start your... "education":

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines deal damage to buildings.</li>
			<li>You can seamlessly stack different Mine types on top of each other by box selecting your hero and the Mine you want to stack on. Then hit the
				spell hotkey and click on the portrait of the Mine you're stacking on top of. This is useful for Prox+Stasis combos since they have the same
				trigger radius and can also be useful for creating clean stacks of Remotes so enemies can't easily tell how many there are.</li>
			<li>At low levels, it's often more efficient to spend all your unreliable gold and kill yourself with Blast Off rather than
				TPing to base and walking back to lane.</li>
			<li>Dazzle's Shallow Grave can save you from dying to the self-damage from a Blast Off cast.</li>
			<li>Blast Off is one of the few movement spells that is not prevented when rooted.</li>
			<li>If you're banished while flying in Blast Off, your spell will land with the silence and damage, but you won't take the self-damage.</li>
			<li>Magic resistance can reduce the Blast Off self damage. Eternal Shroud works on self damage and can give you back mana from a Blast Off.</li>
			<li>If you plant a mine directly underneath yourself after Blasting Off into some enemies, they may struggle to right click it underneath your
				hero model.</li>
			<li>Respect the z-axis when casting Blast Off. If your Blast Off trajectory sends your hero over a cliff, you may end up landing on the cliff instead of your
				targeted AoE.</li>
			<li>You can pretty consistently and pretty buggily Blast Off to the very center of the map on demand. Here are the steps: Begin your Blast Off
				cast animation. Get stunned by an enemy in the middle of the animation. Target and activate Focused Detonate anywhere on the map during the stun.
				Let your Blast Off complete after the enemy stun wears off and get ready to type '?' in chat.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Plant a Sign before Agh's Scepter and then hide yourself off the map to freak enemies out and make them think, "Wait, does he have a Scepter?"
				This is also useful because picking up an Agh's Scepter will instantly upgrade a placed Sign.</li>
			<li>Everyone expects a pile of Remotes under a tower when sieging a team with Techies, but the gaps between tier 1 and tier 2 or tier 2
				and tier 3 towers are often left undetected.</li>
			<li>Similarly, everyone expects a pile of Remotes to be in <i>front</i> of a tower, but they rarely expect them to be <i>behind</i> a tower. Teams
				will often try to keep a sentry juuuust out of tower range which conveniently won't catch the back half of a tower's AoE. These Remotes won't save the tower,
				but they'll definitely stop enemies if they start advancing to the next tier tower.</li>
			<li>The Remote Mine bounty isn't <i>that</i> much. You give 10 gold and 6 experience per mine destroyed, so sometimes you're better off
				letting the enemy team waste time destroying each mine rather than exploding them all out of frustration if your minefield gets swept.</li>
			<li>Lay Remotes all along the lanes during the late game. If you die, you can continue cutting the wave with Remotes to stall a
				push, rather than going all-in on a tier 3 mine stash.</li>
			<li>You can cancel the cast animation for Remote Mines pretty much up until the Mine actually makes contact with the ground.</li>
			<li>Remote Mines last for 10 minutes each and provide 700 ground vision. Place them on cliffs or near rune spots to serve as wards and always keep
				at least one in the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/an7iw5/there_are_blind_spots_in_rosh_pit_where_you_cant/">There are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the
				Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it.</a> You can use this to potentially hide Remote Mines from a casual sweep of the pit.</li>
			<li>Remote Mines give ground vision when placed, but they give 500 flying vision for 3 seconds after they detonate. You can use this to find enemies hiding in trees
				or to look past cliffs.</li>
			<li>You can't cast Focused Detonate when disabled, but you can box-select Remote Mines and detonate them manually.</li>
			<li>When box-selecting Remote Mines, you can shift+left click individual portraits to deselect Mines if you don't want to blow the entire depot.</li>
			<li>You can cast Focused Detonate when you're dead.</li>
			<li>All placed Proximity Mines will dynamically level up as more points are put into the spell. Remote Mines and Stasis Traps don't level up and stay
				at the same level as when they were placed. However, placed Remote Mines do dynamically upgrade/downgrade when picking up or losing an Agh's Scepter.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of dropping/backpacking INT/mana items to get more effective regen when you use Soul Ring or Arcane Boots.</li>
			<li>You can buy a Void Stone in the secret shop and sell it back before 10 seconds pass to get some free regen. You turn
				the gold unreliable, but Techies benefits a lot from mana regen items, even in short bursts.</li>
			<li>Towers and creeps won't attack any of Techies' Mines for some reason. You could theoretically sit near the enemy fountain, place 10 Remote Mines, and instagib
				someone respawning and they can't do a damn thing about it. Disclaimer: Not easy to perform.</li>
			<li>Spell damage amplification from items like Kaya do not boost Mine damage since the Mine itself is the source of the damage, not your hero.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't listen to music when you're playing against Techies. Proximity Mines make a noise when you walk into the trigger AoE.</li>
			<li>Walking couriers can trigger Proximity Mines, but won't take any damage from them.</li>
			<li>Flying units cannot trigger or be damaged by Proximity Mines, but can trip Stasis Traps.</li>
			<li>Invisible units can trigger and be damaged by Proximity Mines, but won't trip Stasis Traps.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines are invisible once armed until you walk into their AoE, even Gem/sentry wards can't spot them.
				Stasis and Remote Mines stay invisible until they detonate, but can be spotted by Gem/sentry wards.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines and Stasis Traps only take one attack to be destroyed. <b>SO PLEASE. ATTACK. THE MINES.</b> <i>Especially,</i> as a carry. Your
				attack speed is way higher than a support, so you can kill them and lose minimal positioning.</li>
			<li>Damage absorbed from Mines during Blade Mail does not reflect onto Techies.</li>
			<li>Attack+moving will <i>not</i> target Mines. You have to manually right click each one to attack them.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The cooldown and duration on the Agh's Scepter Minefield Sign which gives true-sight-proof invisibility to Mines is looooong. Rather than
				gambling on whether or not the Sign is a bluff or not, you may want to just push a different lane.</li>
			<li>Stuns and other disables <i>won't</i> stop a Techies that's in flight from a Blast Off, but sources of forced movement can.
				This means cycloning or Force Staffing a Techies that's Blasting Off will cancel the explosion. Weird spells that move the enemy vertically,
				like Sand King's Burrowstrike, Nyx's Impale, Lion's Earth Spike, and Rubick's Telekinesis, or horizontally,
				like Drow Ranger's Gust, KotL's Blinding Light, and Storm Spirit's Electric Vortex, will also cancel the explosion.</li>
			<li>Techies can do very little when getting Battery Assaulted by a Clockwerk since his cast animations take so long.</li>
			<li>If you are ever pushing a structure or taking Rosh, you need Sentry Wards or a Gem. No exceptions. Plop the Sentry down right in the tower's
				true sight AoE if you have to. Whatever it takes to guarantee an area is clean before taking an objective.</li>
			<li>Stay away from treelines when pushing the mid or safe lane tier 2 tower against Techies. It's a favorite area for hidden Remote stashes.</li>
			<li>Techies players loooove going for offensive Force Staff plays, so be very wary if you see that item in his inventory.</li>
			<li>You're allowed to chase an exposed Techies for about 600 units without detection before you need to start evaluating your life
				decisions. Nine times out of ten he's just trying to Hansel and Gretel your ass into his gingerbread house of Remote Mines whenever
				he's spotted out.</li>
			<li>Be very careful when walking up any high ground stairs. Even if you have true sight in the area, you might not have actual vision
				to see if the top of the stairs are a minefield. Spells that provide vision can often be worth using just to verify a fogged area
				is safe.</li>
			<li>Haven't seen Techies leave a certain side of the map in a while? That's cool, leave him alone and go push another lane. Techies
				is mostly useless without prep time, so Techies players have to guess where your team is going next and prime the area. Keep strong vision
				on the map, not so you can find and kill him, but rather so you can find him, watch him, and verify that he's wasting his time.</li>
			<li>In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. That way you can keep track of Techies and make sure he's
				not hiding mines in the treeline.</li>
			<li>Heroes with long attack range and methods of getting vision over trees or breaking trees can be useful against Techies. Lina, Venomancer,
				Ancient Apparition, or Beastmaster can be useful to have.</li>
			</li>
			<li>All of Techies' damage is magical, so items like Glimmer Cape or Pipe can improve your survivability. Or if you're a carry,
				get a BKB so you can siege high ground in peace for at least a few seconds.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrops can give you some very valuable early game survivability against a Techies.</li>
