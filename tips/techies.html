		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
    	<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oVTd4XY.jpg">Know your tricky Land Mine spots.</a> This is on the pre-6.86 map and back when
				Techies used to be able to kill everyone with 3 land mines, but most of the information is the same. Also, know these
				<a href="http://imgur.com/a/nECro">super stupid offlane mines</a>.</li>
    	<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/4h8n83/techies_sneaky_mine_and_sign_spots/">Know your tricky Remote
				mine and sign spots.</a> Don't put too much stock in the red tree-red sign theory, though, because people have pay2win methods
				to bypass that now.</li>
			<li>If you really want to take the hero seriously, you need to get good at math. Early game Techies is all about
				optimization and understanding how armor and HP affect Land Mine and Suicide's damage.</li>
			<li>Be very careful with vision, and know exactly how far enemy heroes and creeps can see so you can mine undetected.
				Nights are your friend. Trees are your friend.</li>
			<li>If you're Mining smack dab in the middle of the lane, you should probably put down a safety Stasis to keep you protected
				in case the enemy is making a move on you.</li>
			<li>When pushing with your team, insulate your getaway by pre-planting a Stasis on your likely escape route in case things go
				haywire.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens allows you to easily dump Stasis Traps in trees.</li>
			<li>Everyone expects a pile of remotes under a tower when sieging a team with Techies, but the gaps between T1 and T2 or T2
				and T3 towers are often left undetected.</li>
			<li>Lay Remotes all along the lanes during the late game. If you die, you can continue cutting the wave with Remotes to stall a
				push, rather than going all-in on a T3 mine stash.</li>
			<li>If you box-select a bunch of Remote Mines, you can shift+left click a portrait or a mine itself to individually deselect them.
				If you only need 3 Remotes to kill a target, but they're about to walk over a stash of 8, don't blow the entire depot.</li>
			<li>Remotes have 700 day and night vision, so it can be worth placing them on cliffs just to serve as budget wards.</li>
			<li>You can cancel the cast animation for Remote Mines pretty much up until the mine actually makes contact with the ground. If
				you're in the middle of a teamfight and trying to get some good damage, cast and cancel it like a Split Earth until you're sure
				you're satisfied.</li>
			<li>Keep a Remote in the Rosh pit. You don't need to gamble on a big kill and set up an armory in the pit, but you should at least
				keep vision in there at all times.</li>
			<li>Smoke is great on Techies since you get bonus movespeed and you never right click to break the Smoke anyway.</li>
			<li>Always take advantage of dropping INT/mana items to get more regen when you use Soul Ring or Arcane Boots. This is way more effective
				than you'd think it would be, especially post-Agh.</li>
			<li>Late game, don't worry about dealing damage with Suicide, you're in it for the respawn timer reduction.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid to buy Void Stones or Sage Masks in the side shop and then sell them 8 seconds later to get some free regen. You turn
				the gold unreliable, sure, but Techies benefits a lot from % mana regen items, even in short bursts.</li>
			<li>...so you know how structures break Smoke, right? Well the Fountain actually doesn't. <i>Soooo</i> you can actually walk into the enemy
				Fountain under Smoke and do things like... pick up some items that may be lying around in there. This is actually a tip for teams both
				playing with and against Techies because the Gem arms race gets very intense. Stash your Gems, kids. Don't leave them lying on the floor.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Heroes with cheap summons (Beastmaster, Lycan, Invoker, Broodmother, Enigma, NP) or illusion heroes/illusion runes are
				invaluable when dealing with Land Mines.</li>
			<li>Consider building a Helm of the Dominator and just constantly having creeps roaming around the map blowing up Land Mines.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw's Timber Chain allows him to fly over and trigger Land Mines without taking damage from them.</li>
			<li>Dazzle with Shallow Grave and Pugna with Decrepify can run face first into a Land Mined area and walk out alive. . Oracle with Fate's Edict can walk face
				first into a Remote Mined area and hope the Techies player doesn't realize it gives full magic immunity.</li>
			<li>The concept of investing in a Gem pre-20 minutes is a terrifying proposition to many lower level players, but that baby will
				win you games against a Techies.</li>
			<li>Quelling Blade, Iron Talon, and Battle Fury can instantly kill Land/Stasis/Remote mines. Even as a ranged hero it can be worth
				buying these, especially in late game situations where you may only get milliseconds of vision on high ground to kill mines.</li>
			<li>Get to the lane. Fast. Pre-game time is invaluable for Techies players. Find out where he's hiding or just verify that certain
				areas are safe.</li>
			<li>You're allowed to chase a Techies for about 400 units without detection before you start need to really evaluating your life
				decisions. Nine times out of ten he's just trying to Hansel and Gretel your ass into his gingerbread house of mines whenever
				he's spotted out.</li>
			<li><i>ALWAYS. ATTACK. THE STASIS TRAP. PLEASE. IT ONLY TAKES ONE ATTACK.</i></li>
			<li>Stasis Traps won't trigger on invis units, unlike Land Mines.</li>
			<li>It's okay to place a sentry ward in tower vision if it means you can certify that the area is clean during a push.</li>
			<li>Stay away from treelines when pushing the mid tier 2 tower against Techies. It's a favorite area for hidden Remote stashes.</li>
			<li>Soul Ring leaves a buff on heroes even if they've used all the mana. If you look for this buff when he's bobbing in and out
				of fog, it'll help tell you that he just placed a mine.</li>
			<li>Techies players loooove going for offensive Force Staff plays, so be very wary if you see that item in their inventory.</li>
			<li>Haven't seen Techies leave a certain side of the map in a while? That's cool, leave him alone and go push another lane. Techies
				is useless without setup time, so Techies players have to guess where your team is going next and prime the area. Keep strong vision
				on the map, not so you can find him and kill him, but rather so you can find him, watch him, and verify that he's wasting his time.</li>
