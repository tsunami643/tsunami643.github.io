		<h1>Tips</h1>
    	<ul>
			<li>There is really no quick and dirty way to explain how to play Techies. Actually, all ways explaining how to
				play Techies are dirty, but there is no quick way. With that in mind, here are a few resources that can help
				jump-start your... "education":

					Techies Tricks in 7.07c</a></li>

					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clH-XvwAxs0#t=3m">Radiant Offlane Jungle Farming</a> videos</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines deal damage to buildings.</li>
			<li>You can seamlessly stack Mines on top of each other by box selecting your hero and the Mine you want to stack on. Then hit the
				spell hotkey and click on the portrait of the Mine you're stacking on top of. This is useful for Prox+Stasis combos since they have the same
				trigger radius and useful for creating clean stacks of Remotes so enemies can't easily tell how many there are.</li>
			<li>At low levels, it's often more efficient to spend all your unreliable gold and kill yourself with Blast Off rather than
				TPing to base and walking back to lane.</li>
			<li>Shallow Grave can save you from dying to the self-damage from a Blast Off cast.</li>
			<li>Blast Off is one of the few movement spells that is not prevented when rooted.</li>
			<li>Plant a Sign before Agh's and then hide yourself off the map to freak enemies out and make them think, "Wait, does he have an Agh's?"
				This is also useful because picking up an Agh's will instantly upgrade a placed Sign.</li>
			<li>Everyone expects a pile of Remotes under a tower when sieging a team with Techies, but the gaps between T1 and T2 or T2
				and T3 towers are often left undetected.</li>
			<li>The Remote Mine bounty isn't <i>that</i> much. You give 10 gold and 6 experience per mine destroyed, so sometimes you're better off
				letting the enemy team waste time destroying each mine rather than exploding them all out of frustration if your minefield gets swept.</li>
			<li>Lay Remotes all along the lanes during the late game. If you die, you can continue cutting the wave with Remotes to stall a
				push, rather than going all-in on a T3 mine stash.</li>
			<li>You can cancel the cast animation for Remote Mines pretty much up until the Mine actually makes contact with the ground.</li>
			<li>Remote Mines last for 10 minutes each and provide 700 ground vision. Place them on cliffs or near rune spots to serve as wards and always keep
				at least one in the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Remote Mines give ground vision when placed, but they give 500 flying vision for 3 seconds after they detonate. You can use this to find enemies hiding in trees
				or to look past cliffs.</li>
			<li>You can't cast Focused Detonate when disabled, but you can box-select Remote Mines and detonate them manually.</li>
			<li>When box-selecting Remote Mines, you can shift+left click individual portraits to deselect Mines if you don't want to blow the entire depot.</li>
			<li>You can cast Focused Detonate when you're dead.</li>
			<li>All placed Proximity Mines will dynamically level up as more points are put into the spell. Remote Mines and Stasis Traps don't level up and stay
				at the same level as when they were placed. However, placed Remote Mines do dynamically upgrade/downgrade when picking up or losing an Agh's Scepter.</li>
			<li>Techies' super high right click range is balanced by his damage barely tickling most enemies. If you want to be
				slightly better at harassing in lane, consider buying an Orb of Venom for the magic damage DoT.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of dropping/backpacking INT/mana items to get more effective regen when you use Soul Ring or Arcane Boots.</li>
			<li>You can buy a Void Stone in the side shop or secret shop and sell it back before 10 seconds pass to get some free regen. You turn
				the gold unreliable, but Techies benefits a lot from mana regen items, even in short bursts.</li>
			<li>Towers and creeps won't attack any of Techies' Mines for some reason. You could theoretically Smoke up, sit in the enemy fountain, place 10 Remote Mines, and instagib
				someone respawning and they can't do a damn thing about it. Disclaimer: Not easy to perform.</li>
			<li>You can also Smoke up to infiltrate the fountain to see if the enemy has any Gems laying around if they were too dumb to stash them.</li>
			<li>Spell amplification from items like Kaya do not boost Mine damage since the Mine itself is the source of the damage, not your hero.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't listen to music when you're playing against Techies. Proximity Mines make a noise when you walk into the trigger AoE.</li>
			<li>Flying units cannot trigger or be damaged by Proximity Mines, but can trip Stasis Traps.</li>
			<li>Invisible units can trigger and be damaged by Proximity Mines, but won't trip Stasis Traps.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines are invisible once armed until you walk into their AoE. Stasis and Remote Mines stay invisible until they detonate.</li>
			<li>Proximity Mines and Stasis Traps only take one attack to be destroyed. SO PLEASE. ATTACK. THE MINES.</li>
			<li>Stasis Traps and Remote Mines can be destroyed instantly when targeted with a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury, but not Prox Mines.</li>
			<li>Damage absorbed from Mines during Blade Mail does not reflect onto Techies.</li>
			<li>Attack+moving will <i>not</i> target Mines. You have to manually right click each one to attack them.</li>
			<li>The cooldown on the Agh's Minefield Sign which gives true-sight-proof invisibility to Mines is looooong. Rather than
				gambling on whether or not the Sign is a bluff or not, you may want to just push a different lane.</li>
			<li>Stuns and other disables won't stop a Techies that's in flight from a Blast Off, but sources of forced movement can.
				This means cycloning or Force Staffing a Techies that's Blasting Off will cancel the explosion. Weird spells that move the enemy vertically,
				like Burrowstrike, Impale, and Telekinesis, or horizontally, like Gust, Blinding Light, and Electric Vortex, will also cancel the explosion.</li>
			<li>Techies can do very little when getting Battery Assaulted by a Clockwerk since his cast animations take so long.</li>
			<li>If you are ever pushing a structure or taking Rosh, you need Sentry Wards or a Gem. No exceptions. Plop the Sentry down right in the tower's
				true sight AoE if you have to. Whatever it takes to guarantee an area is clean before taking an objective.</li>
			<li>Stay away from treelines when pushing the mid or safe lane tier 2 tower against Techies. It's a favorite area for hidden Remote stashes.</li>
			<li>Techies players loooove going for offensive Force Staff plays, so be very wary if you see that item in his inventory.</li>
			<li>You're allowed to chase an exposed Techies for about 600 units without detection before you need to start evaluating your life
				decisions. Nine times out of ten he's just trying to Hansel and Gretel your ass into his gingerbread house of Remote Mines whenever
				he's spotted out.</li>
			<li>Haven't seen Techies leave a certain side of the map in a while? That's cool, leave him alone and go push another lane. Techies
				is useless without setup time, so Techies players have to guess where your team is going next and prime the area. Keep strong vision
				on the map, not so you can find him and kill him, but rather so you can find him, watch him, and verify that he's wasting his time.</li>
