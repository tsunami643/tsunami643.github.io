		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can mask the animation of Hoof Stomp by casting it in the middle of using a Force Staff. Since the
				cast time takes roughly as long as the Force travel time, you'll arrive at your destination and stomp
				immediately without showing the Hoof Stomp animation.</li>
			<li>Double Edge costs no mana, so use it as your primary pushing spell late game.</li>
			<li>If you have a Hood of Defiance, don't forget to use the active Spell Shield liberally to absorb Double Edge
				self damage.</li>
			<li>Retaliate damages towers. Be a man and draw aggro from the tower to speed up the pushing process. If you
				want to force aggro, right click any enemy hero anywhere on the map while you're in tower range, or just
				be the closest target attacking the tower.</li>
			<li>You also build Retaliate stacks off of tower hits.</li>
			<li>Taking attacks from enemy illusions will add stacks to Retaliate.</li>
			<li>The "Retaliate Aura" talent only gives teammates the Return damage. Centaur still won't get any Retaliate stacks
				unless he's attacked directly.</li>
			<li>All Returned damage under the "Retaliate Aura" talent credits Centaur as the damage source.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to when you can use Stampede from across the map. If your boy Shadow Fiend is getting
				ganked, don't be shy about turning on your lawnmower with R. Similarly, if SF is ganking Luna, but just
				can't keep up, use your ultimate.</li>
			<li>Stampede boosts the movespeed of all allied heroes and summons, excluding ward-type units. All Stampeding
				units can apply the slow on enemies.</li>
			<li>Leave Tranquil Boots in your backpack when farming the jungle and put them back in your inventory before finishing the camp
				so you don't trigger the damage cooldown.</li>
			<li>After you get Blade Mail, try to find ways to hurt yourself during its duration. KotL about to bust out
				an Illuminate? Gimme. Chaos Meteor rolling around? I love meatballs. Bloodseeker Rupture you for some
				reason? Yeeeeehaw.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hoof Stomp has a pretty small radius. If you see a Centaur is trying to run side by side with you to
				ensure that he'll land it, don't keep moving straight, juke left or right.</li>
			<li>Attacks from Moon Glaives, Split Shot, and Flak Cannon won't trigger Retaliate unless Centaur is the primary target.</li>
		</ul>
