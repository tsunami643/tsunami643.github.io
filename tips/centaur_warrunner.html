		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can mask the animation of Hoof Stomp by casting it in the middle of using a Force Staff. Since the
				cast time takes roughly as long as the Force travel time, you'll arrive at your destination and stomp
				immediately without showing the Hoof Stomp animation.</li>
			<li>Double Edge costs no mana, so use it as your primary pushing spell late game. The AoE is bigger than you
				think and once you get a Hood of Defiance (which reduces the damage you take from Double Edge)+Heart,
				you should easily be able to take down a creep wave in a few seconds between Double Edge and Return.</li>
			<li>Return damages towers. Be a man and draw aggro from the tower to speed up the pushing process. If you
				want to force aggro, right click any enemy hero anywhere on the map while you're in tower range, or just
				be the closest target attacking the tower.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to when you can use Stampede from across the map. If your boy Shadow Fiend is getting
				ganked, don't be shy about turning on your lawnmower with R. Similarly, if SF is ganking Luna, but just
				can't keep up, use your ultimate.</li>
			<li>Many players will leave their Tranquil Boots on the ground when farming so that they can pick them up
				after getting some last hits and not have to wait for the damage cooldown to start healing.</li>
			<li>After you get Blade Mail, try to find ways to hurt yourself during its duration. KotL about to bust out
				an Illuminate? Gimme. Chaos Meteor rolling around? I love meatballs. Bloodseeker Rupture you for some
				reason? Yeeeeehaw.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hoof Stomp has a pretty small radius. If you see a Centaur is trying to run side by side with you to
				ensure that he'll land it, don't keep moving straight, juke left or right.</li>
