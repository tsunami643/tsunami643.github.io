		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Earthbind can root and reveal invisible targets.</li>
			<li>The Earthbind projectile provides flying vision in a small radius as it travels.</li>
			<li>Earthbinding an enemy unit provides shared vision over that target (you see what the rooted unit can see).
				This works on enemy heroes and creeps, but shared vision is not provided when rooting neutrals.</li>
			<li>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there
				should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep
				one somewhere safe in the jungle.</li>
			<li>Enabling quickcast for Meepo in your options will generally make Poofing much, much, simpler.</li>
			<li>You can Poof to illusions of your hero that are owned by you or your team.</li>
			<li>Poof deals damage at the starting and ending locations of a Meepo. If they Poof onto themselves, both damage
				instances happen around the unit.</li>
			<li>You can cast Eul's on any of your Meepos. You can cast E-Blade on any of your Meepos.</li>
			<li>Every Meepo can pick up and use runes.</li>
			<li>Only the primary Meepo benefits from Moon Shard attack speed.</li>
			<li>Power Treads benefit Meepo's clones twofold. They get the bonus stats from your primary Meepo having Power Treads
				and they get their own bonus stats from their own Power Treads.</li>
			<li>If the primary Meepo dies to a neutral, you have to wait the full neutral death penalty time. If a clone dies to a neutral
				or Rosh, there is no added penalty and your death time is calculated off your level.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Meepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. A way to counter
				that is with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out or by using silences, roots, or multiple instance
				stuns (like Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Enigma's Malefice, Invoker's Cold Snap, or Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask).</li>
			<li>All you really need against Meepo is to have a ton of single target damage to kill one Meepo. You don't get extra credit for dealing damage to his
				every Meepo. You only need to kill one.</li>
			<li>There is very little Meepo can do to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse. Late game, a Meepo can bait the Curse on a secondary
				Meepo and then E-Blade the one that's Cursed, but that makes initiation very tricky for the Meepo.</li>
			<li>Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to
				predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.</li>
			<li>Pangolier gets more damage reduction for each Meepo hit by his Shield Crash.</li>
			<li>Pretty much all of Grimstroke's spells aside from Phantom's Embrace are amazing against Meepo.</li>
			<li>Elder Titan gets a ton of buffs for running over a bunch of Meepos with his Spirit.</li>
			<li>Shiva's Guard can be pretty value versus a Meepo with the attack/movespeed slow, AoE damage, and HP regen reduction.</li>
