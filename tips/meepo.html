		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>There are a few unique item interactions to be aware of when taking the "Pack Rat" facet.
				<ul>
					<li>The "Philosopher's Stone" neutral item adds GPM for every Meepo.</li>
					<li>Any item that has a passive effect will have independent cooldowns on each Meepo. For example, every Meepo can proc the
						"Stormcrafter" neutral item passive zaps without sharing a cooldown.</li>
					<li>Basher, Maelstrom, Echo Sabre, and any neutral item that has a cooldown activated on attacks will <i>not</i> proc their passives when used
						from secondary Meepos.</li>
					<li>Radiance does not work on secondary Meepos, however, the "Cloak of Flames" neutral item does work.</li>
					<li>Items with charges will copy the main Meepo's charges. Each secondary Meepo will use their charges independently
						without affecting any other Meepos charges.</li>
					<li>You can cheese items with charges on secondary Meepos by swapping the item in and out of your main Meepo's neutral
						item slot. Every time an item gets swapped in, all secondary Meepos will re-copy the main Meepo's charges again.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Earthbind can root and reveal invisible targets.</li>
			<li>The Earthbind projectile provides flying vision in a small radius as it travels.</li>
			<li>Earthbinding an enemy unit provides shared vision over that target (you see what the rooted unit can see).
				This works on enemy heroes and creeps, but shared vision is not provided when rooting neutrals.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets" talent isn't just for Meepo, it also gives teammates true strike
				on targets affected by Earthbind.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets" talent works against debuff immune/BKB'd enemies. They won't be rooted,
				but you'll still get true strike for as long as the debuff is on them.</li>
			<li>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there
				should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep
				one somewhere safe in the jungle.</li>
			<li>You can Poof to illusions of your hero that are owned by you or your team.</li>
			<li>Poof deals damage at the starting and ending locations of a Meepo. If they Poof onto themselves, both damage
				instances happen around the unit.</li>
			<li>You can cast Eul's Scepter (don't need Wind Waker) on any of your Meepos.</li>
			<li>Every Meepo can pick up and use runes.</li>
			<li>Only the primary Meepo benefits from Moon Shard attack speed.</li>
			<li>If the primary Meepo dies to a neutral, you have to wait the full neutral death penalty time. If a clone dies to a neutral
				or Rosh, there is no added penalty and your death time is calculated off your level.</li>
			<li>Consider enabling the console command <font face="courier new">dota_player_smart_multiunit_cast true</font> if you're playing Meepo or Arc Warden.
				This command makes the game attempt to cast a targeted spell on the first unit that doesn't have the spell on cooldown <i>without</i> you tabbing through control groups.
				<ul><li>Here's an example: You have your hero and your other Meepos <b>all</b> selected. You cast Earthbind from your hero and put the spell on cooldown.
				You can press the spell hotkey again and the game will attempt to cast the spell, skip your hero because it's on cooldown,
				and then make the next Meepo cast Earthbind. It'll continue skipping any Meepos who have the spell on cooldown until it finds a valid one.</li></ul>
			<li>If you need to get to a place quickly on the map from the fountain, you can theoretically buy Boots of Travel, use them from a clone, and then sell
				them from your hero for the full price. It turns the gold unreliable, but could be handy in certain situations.</li>
			<li>While secondary Meepos are capable of gaining experience, they gain a reduced percentage. If you can keep your main hero around when units die,
				you'll level up faster.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Any buffs/debuffs that were on secondary Meepos before you MegaMeepo'd will continue, but they'll be invulnerable
				and untargetable as long as they're standing on your head.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Any buffs/debuffs applied to your Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo will continue on to your primary Meepo once the spell
				times out.
				<ul><li>If you pick up a shield rune while in MegaMeepo, you get to keep the gigantic barrier on your primary Meepo.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Dropping/backpacking Agh's Scepter will immediately end MegaMeepo. You can use this as an eject button if you
				don't want to wait for the spell to time out.
				<ul><li>You can even backpack Agh's Scepter while MegaMeepo is stunned or banished or under some other debuff and your secondary Meepos
					will immediately be free to act while your primary Meepo continues the debuff.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo can't save Meepos that are in Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Legion
				Commander's Duel. You <i>can</i> save them from spells like Batrider's Lasso, Doom's Doom, Necrophos's Reaper's Scythe, and Primal Beast's Pulverize.
				<ul><li>You can also save Meepos from Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, but I'm pretty sure it's unintended. If you Poof into your Cursed
				crew and shift+queue MegaMeepo, you'll make a frozen tower of Meepos and walk away from the Curse.</li>
				<li>This also works against Disruptor's Static Field.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Upon ending Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo, your secondary Meepos will continue performing the last action you gave them
				before you went MegaMeepoMode. So be prepared for them to run in some dumb directions once the MegaMeepo falls apart.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to
				predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.</li>
			<li>Meepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. A way to counter
				that is with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out or by using silences, roots/leashes, or multi-instance
				stuns (like Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Enigma's Malefice, Invoker's Cold Snap, or Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask).</li>
			<li>All you really need against Meepo is to have a ton of single target damage to kill one Meepo. You don't get extra credit for dealing damage to his
				every Meepo. You only need to kill one.</li>
			<li>Meepo struggles to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse. <i>Technically,</i> if you don't catch the primary Meepo he can pull some Agh's Scepter
				MegaMeepo shenanigans to get out, but only the godliest Meepos know about that tech that is literally one scroll up on this screen.</li>
			<li>Each Meepo counts as an individual hero when calculating Pangolier's Shield Crash buff.</li>
			<li>Pretty much all of Grimstroke's spells aside from Phantom's Embrace are amazing against Meepo.</li>
			<li>Elder Titan gets a ton of buffs for running over a bunch of Meepos with his Spirit.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Meepo can't cast Agh's Shard Dig while rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Individual Meepos can be Tracked by Bounty Hunter and when one dies you get gold for each one Tracked.</li>
			<li>Shiva's Guard can be pretty value versus a Meepo with the attack/move speed slow, AoE damage, and HP regen reduction.</li>
