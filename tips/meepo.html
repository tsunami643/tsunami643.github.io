		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Earthbind can root and reveal invisible targets.</li>
			<li>The Earthbind projectile provides flying vision in a small radius as it travels.</li>
			<li>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there
				should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep
				one somewhere safe in the jungle.</li>
			<li>Enabling quickcast for Meepo in your options will generally make Poofing much, much, simpler.</li>
			<li>You can Poof to illusions owned by you.</li>
			<li>You can cast Eul's on any of your Meepos. You can cast E-Blade on any of your Meepos.</li>
			<li>Only the primary Meepo benefits from Moon Shard attack speed.</li>
			<li>Power Treads benefit Meepo's clones twofold. They get the bonus stats from your primary Meepo having Power Treads
				and they get their own bonus stats from their own Power Treads. This is also true when hanging around
				Luna's Lunar Blessing or other attribute boosting skills.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Meepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. A way to counter
				that is with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out or by using silences, roots, or multiple instance
				stuns (Malefice, Cold Snap, Paralyzing Cask).</li>
			<li>All you really need against Meepo is to have a ton of single target damage to kill one Meepo. You don't get extra credit for dealing damage to his
				every Meepo. You only need to kill one.</li>
			<li>There is very little Meepo can do to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse. Late game, a Meepo can bait the Curse on a secondary
				Meepo and then E-Blade the one that's Cursed, but that makes initiation very tricky for the Meepo.</li>
			<li>Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to
				predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.</li>
			<li>Individual Meepos each give bonus Track gold when they all die.</li>
			<li>Pangolier gets more damage reduction for each Meepo hit by his Shield Crash.</li>
