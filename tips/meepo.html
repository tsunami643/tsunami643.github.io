		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Each Meepo is counting as a hero to split XP. If you have 3 Meepos and 1 Dazzle in the lane, Meepo is
				getting 75% of the experience, even though there are technically only 2 heroes there.</li>
			<li>The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there
				should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep
				one somewhere safe in the jungle.</li>
			<li>If you don't have the micro skills for the Blink to Superpoof combo, consider getting a Shadow Blade to
				do it.</li>
			<li>Enabling quickcast in your options will generally make Poofing much, much, simpler.</li>
			<li>You can Poof to illusions owned by you.</li>
			<li>You can cast Eul's on any of your Meepos. You can cast EBlade on any of your Meepos.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Meepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. The ways to counter
				that is to either make sure he never has any healthy Meepos available to substitute in with lots of AoE damage (especially
				scaling AoE damage like Sleight of Fist or Echo Slam) or with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out with
				silences or multiple instance stuns (Malefice, Cold Snap, Paralyzing Cask).</li>
			<li>There is really nothing Meepo can do to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse.</li>
			<li>Or roots. Meepo can't use Poof when rooted.</li>
			<li>The obvious counter is to have high burst so that Meepo won't even have time to react to rescue one of his bodies, but
				remember that Meepo has slightly higher than average magic resistance (35% vs. the standard 25%)</li>
			<li>Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to
				predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.</li>
			<li>Earthbind does not cancel channels.</li>
