		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Phoenix always Icarus Dives clockwise.</li>
			<li>Icarus Dive applies a slow on enemies. Don't just use it as a gap closer and cancel before you land on an enemy, bathe them
				in the fire debuff first.</li>
			<li>You can pick things up mid-Dive. You can use this to snatch runes and carry on with your business.
				To time it properly, just cast the Dive at the X:00 mark. To position it properly, just hover over the spell and you can
				see the green circle cast range.</li>
			<li>You can begin channeling an Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher mid-Dive. Just be aware that if you cancel the Dive, you cancel the channel. So ideally
				you want to start the channeling from the tip of your Dive.</li>
			<li>You can cast spells and items while flying in Icarus Dive. This is important when trying to catch enemies, lay some damage on them with
				items or Fire Spirits, and then safely retreat in the Dive.
				<ul><li>Shiva's Guard takes a little longer than ~2 seconds to fully expand and will affect any units it
				makes contact with while expanding. Don't jump into an Icarus Dive the moment you cast it or you'll
				waste a ton of the Arctic Blast radius.</li>
				<li>You can begin channeling a TP while Diving, but canceling the Dive will cancel the TP.</li>
				<li>You can begin channeling a Meteor Hammer mid-Dive.</li></ul>
			<li>Don't rapid fire your Fire Spirits on single targets. The debuff lasts for a few seconds and the damage from multiple Spirits do <i>not</i> stack,
				they just refresh the debuff. Enemies are much more wary of a Phoenix who still has a Spirit circling around them. Space out Launches,
				even if you don't land them.</li>
			<li>Fire Spirits briefly provide ground vision wherever they land. Useful for scouting Rosh or counterwarding cliffs.</li>
			<li>Sun Ray provides vision over the 'projectile,' allowing you to check the Rosh pit or scout in trees with the beam of fire.</li>
			<li>Sun Ray does not work on Rosh.</li>
			<li>You can cast all your spells while Sun Ray is out.
				<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>If you have Agh's Shard, always try to cast Sun Ray <i>before</i> activating Supernova.
				Supernova refreshes cooldowns on cast, not when the spell ends. So if you Sun Ray mid-Supernova, you'll respawn with
				Sun Ray on cooldown.</li></ul>
			<li>You can cast items while in Sun Ray. In fact, you don't even have to turn your hero to target items if you cast it
				during Sun Ray.
				<ul><li>If you begin channeling a TP while moving in Sun Ray, you will continue moving during the channel.
					Escape enemies by TPing over cliffs (including the unpathable edges of the map).</li></ul>
			<li>Try to hit enemies with Fire Spirits to slow their attack speed before going into Supernova.
				<ul><li>Hitting enemies with any of your spells will also increase their miss chance thanks to your Blinding Sun innate.</li></ul>
			<li>Try to find cliffs to Supernova onto if the positioning is convenient. Not only are you giving your team vision and potentially
				evading enemy vision, but heroes will also uphill miss while attacking your Egg as well.
			<ul><li>Activating Supernova destroys trees in a huge radius so you can't easily hide the Egg in trees.</li></ul>
			<li>Allies can fog your Supernova Egg with vision blockers like the front of Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier or Nature's Prophet's Sprout trees.</li>
			<li>Supernova forces the entire map to day time during its duration. It'll even override Night Stalker's Dark Ascension and Luna's
				Eclipse that typically force night time.</li>
			<li>Unlike most other ward units, Supernova doesn't take damage from towers or even the enemy fountain.</li>
			<li>For some reason, you can remove Bane's Nightmare off allies while in your Supernova egg if they're in your attack range.</li>
			<li>Allies can deny the Supernova Egg once it's under 50%.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If an ally dies in an Agh's Scepter Supernova, it counts as a deny by Phoenix.</li>
			<li>Self-damage does not proc Aeon Disk, so you don't have to worry about popping your own Disk from
				casting any of your spells.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Icarus Dive can be canceled with stuns, cyclones, hexes, sleeps, fears, and spells/items causing forced movement or knockback.
				Phoenixes will often pull some downright stupid Dives because they assume they'll be able to complete
				the full cycle. If you see a Phoenix staring at you from afar, keep your trigger finger ready on a stun
				to cancel the Dive. This is especially important with instant disables like hexes or Eulses or Force Staffs or Harpoons.</li>
			<li>Phoenix cannot cast Icarus Dive when rooted, but roots won't cancel a Icarus Dive in progress.</li>
			<li>Stunning, silencing, sleeping, cycloning, fearing, or hexing Phoenix during Sun Ray will cancel the spell.</li>
			<li>Nyx Assassin is good at countering Sun Ray since he can just walk into it with Carapace and stun Phoenix ezpz.
				<ul><li><span class="facet"></span>Phoenix is even more vulnerable to Nyx with the "Dying Light" facet constantly dealing damage in an AoE.</li></ul>
			<li>There are a lot of variables deciding this, but a good rule of thumb to follow is that you'll need 2 heroes
				to kill a level 1 Supernova Egg and 3 heroes to kill a level 2 Supernova Egg assuming you're all Fire Spirited right before
				Supernova is cast.</li>
			<li>Heroes that buff attack speed (like Ogre Magi with Bloodlust) or items that buff attack speed (Drum,
				Assault Cuirass) will help a lot with killing Supernovas.</li>
			<li>Snapfire's Lil' Shredder is a great at making an omelette out of the Supernova.</li>
			<li>You can kill the Egg during Naga Siren's Song of the Siren sleep.</li>
			<li>Juggernaut can damage the Egg while right-clicking during Blade Fury.</li>
			<li>Clones like Meepo and Arc Warden's Tempest Double count as heroes when attacking the Egg. Illusions do not and will deal
				no damage to a Supernova.</li>
			<li>Phoenix's Blinding Sun innate applies a stacking miss chance the longer you are debuffed by any of Phoenix's spells.</li>
