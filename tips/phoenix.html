		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Phoenix always Dives clockwise.</li>
			<li>Icarus Dive applies a slow on enemies for 4 seconds at all levels. Don't just use it as a gap closer and cancel
				before you land on an enemy, get within 200 range of them to apply the slow.</li>
			<li>You can begin channeling a TP while Diving, but canceling the Dive will cancel the TP.</li>
			<li>You can pick things up mid-Dive. The Dive travels 1400 range, so you can use this to snatch runes and carry on your business.
				To time it properly, just cast the Dive at the X:00 mark.</li>
			<li>Shiva's Guard takes a little longer than ~2.5 seconds to fully expand and will affect any units it
				makes contact with while expanding. Don't jump into an Icarus Dive the moment you cast it or you'll
				waste ~400 range on the Arctic Blast radius.</li>
			<li>Don't machine-gun Fire Spirits. The debuff lasts for 4 seconds and enemies are more wary of a Phoenix
				who still has a Spirit circling around them. Space out Launches, even if you don't land them.</li>
			<li>You can cast and cancel Icarus Dive while a Sun Ray is out.</li>
			<li>Sun Ray provides vision over the 'projectile,' allowing  you to check Rosh or scout in trees.</li>
			<li>If you begin channeling a TP while moving in Sun Ray, you will continue moving during the channel.
				Escape enemies by TPing over cliffs (including the unpathable edges of the map).</li>
			<li>Try to find cliffs to Supernova onto if the positioning is convenient. Not only are you potentially
				dodging enemy vision, but they'll uphill miss while attacking you as well.</li>
			<li>Supernova turns the entire map to day time during its duration. It also overrides Night Stalker or Luna's
				forced night time spells.</li>
			<li>Allies can deny the Egg once it's under 50%.</li>
			<li>If an ally dies in an Agh's Egg, it counts as a deny by Phoenix.</li>
			<li>Self-damage does not proc Aeon Disk, so you don't have to worry about popping your own Disk from
				casting any of your spells.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Phoenix can be stunned during Icarus Dive. Phoenixes will often pull some downright stupid Dives because
				they assume they'll be able to complete the full cycle. If you see a Phoenix staring at you from afar, keep
				your trigger finger ready on a stun to cancel the Dive. This is especially important with instant disables
				like hexes or Eulses.</li>
			<li>Phoenix cannot Icarus Dive when rooted.</li>
			<li>Stunning, silencing, sleeping, cycloning, fearing, or hexing Phoenix during Sun Ray will cancel the spell.</li>
			<li>Nyx is good at countering Sun Ray since he can just walk into it with Carapace and stun Phoenix ezpz.</li>
			<li>There are a lot of variables deciding this, but a good rule of thumb to follow is that you'll need 2 heroes
				to kill a level 1 Egg and 3 heroes to kill a level 2 Egg assuming you're all Fire Spirited right before
				Supernova is cast.</li>
			<li>Heroes that buff attack speed (Drow Ranger, Beastmaster, Ogre Magi) or items that buff attack speed (Drum,
				AC) will help a lot against Supernovas in the late game.</li>
			<li>You can kill the Egg during Naga sleep.</li>
			<li>Juggernaut can damage the Egg while right-clicking during Blade Fury.</li>
			<li>Silencer can be really irritating for a Phoenix to deal with in lane because if you're Last Worded, you can't cancel
				your Icarus Dive.</li>
			<li>Clones like Meepo and Arc Warden's Tempest Double count as heroes when attacking the Egg. Illusions do not and will deal
				no damage to a Supernova.</li>
