		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Manually casting Frost Arrows on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.</li>
			<li>The knockback on Gust doesn't break item channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.
				<ul><li>However, the knockback mechanic does <i>move</i> enemies, making it cancel things like Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive,
					Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Techies' Blast Off, and Templar Assassin's Meld.</li></ul>
			<li>Gust reveals invisible enemy units for the duration of the silence.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Gust Self Movement Speed" talent works even if you don't hit any enemies with the spell.
				If you need to make a quick escape, just use it on nothing and start running.</li>
			<li>Beware that Gust knockback can potentially push enemies out of a teammate Disruptor's Kinetic Field
				or Slark's Pounce leash.</li>
			<li>Enemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Gust).
				If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.</li>
			<li>Multishot gives a small amount of flying vision over the projectiles.</li>
			<li>Multishot scales off your base damage. It does not multiply 'green' +dmg.</li>
			<li>Despite its appearance, Multishot is <i>not</i> an <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">
				instant attack</a>. Therefore, the arrows do <i>not</i> apply attack modifiers (other than Frost Arrows), the spell won't break enemy Tranquil Boots,
				and it won't remove a Smoke buff off your hero if an attack lands on a target.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>If you take the "Sidestep" facet, Drow can even attack during Multishot <i>but only if you're not moving.</i>
				Also, you can't right click any target during Multishot otherwise that'll cancel the spell. You basically have to stand still while Multishotting
				and Drow will begin attacking then nearest available target.</li>
			<li>You can use Marksmanship's particle effect disappearing on your hero to detect if invis heroes are hugging you.</li>
			<li>Marksmanship procs have true strike. Not only will the Marksmanship damage go through, but so does your right
				click damage. This provides a built-in counter to evasion heroes.</li>
			<li>While Drow's Precision Aura innate does add a buff indicator to creep-heroes (like Visage's Familiars), they can't benefit from the AGI in any way.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>While standing on Agh's Shard Glacier, Marksmanship won't be disabled by nearby enemies.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can activate Agh's Shard Glacier while in the middle of channeling Multishot and it won't cancel it,
				but you won't get the bonus arrows.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Even melee heroes can benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Agh's Shard Glacier.
				<ul><li>All units benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Glacier. Including enemies.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Glacier basically gives Drow a really short duration free pathing buff similar to Spectre's Spectral Dagger.
				The intention is to let you walk off the front of the Glacier, but if you line the Glacier up with a cliff, you can walk over
				walls too.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Standing on Agh's Shard Glacier is like standing on two 'levels' of high ground in terms of how vision works.
				To get vision of you, the enemy would need to have a ward or hero that's two ramps/stairs higher than you, similar to seeing a Monkey King
				that's perched on a tree.
				<ul><li>Most sources of accuracy won't work when attacking buildings, but Agh's Shard Glacier does. If you're sieging
					an enemy high ground tower, you won't miss any attacks on it from low ground if you're standing on Glacier.</li>
				<li><span class="facet"></span>The "Vantage Point" facet benefits from this high ground aspect of Glacier. You can use this to create instant
					high grounds for bonus damage against all units, including Roshan or towers. It doesn't matter how high up the enemy target actually is, standing on
					Glacier always counts as higher ground.</li>
					<li>Be aware attacking any enemies always gives vision of the attacker. So if you're using Glacier
					to hide/escape, don't attack anything.</li></ul>
			<li>Nullifier can dispel the Force Staff buff off heroes. However, it does not dispel the Hurricane Pike pushback buff. If you're trying to
				escape while Nullified, casting Pike on yourself won't work to create a gap, but Piking an enemy will.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Get in her face. There is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. She loses the bonuses from Marksmanship if enemy heroes are
				close to her, so try closing the distance even if you're a ranged hero.
			<ul><li>Illusions won't disable Marksmanship, only actual heroes.</li></ul>
			<li>Drow is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on her.</li>
			<li>Marksmanship procs bypass your hero's <i>main</i> armor, but not bonus armor. This means that armor gained from agility
				won't help you very much against her, but raw armor items can be quite useful.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Hypothermia stacks can be dispelled.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>It doesn't matter whose team the Agh's Shard Glacier belongs to, any unit standing on it gets bonus
				attack range.</li>
		</ul>
