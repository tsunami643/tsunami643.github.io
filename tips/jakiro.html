		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dual Breath can hit targets farther than the max cast range of the spell, so stick to ground targeting if you're
				trying to damage an enemy that's escaping. </li>
			<li>When casting Dual Breath, the slow 'ice' breath is released first, then the DoT 'fire' breath shortly after. So be aware
				that an enemy may be able to react to the first Dual Breath and Blink Dagger out.</li>
			<li>Since Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to preemptively disable enemies. This is good
				against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are Cycloned, or heroes who are
				TPing in to defend a structure.</li>
			<li>Ice Path gives vision. Use it to scout high ground or the Rosh pit or cliffs when dewarding.</li>
			<li>If you're getting chased by a melee enemy, just cast Ice Path in front of yourself and walk through it.
				Jakiro's turn speed and long cast animations make it easy for an enemy to dodge it if you cast it behind yourself
				when they're so close to you.</li>
			<li>Casting Ice Path on an Aegis reincarnation will instantly stun the enemy when they respawn.</li>
			<li>Liquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and is what makes Jakiro a great pusher.</li>
			<li>Try to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly
				change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.</li>
			<li>Manually casting Liquid Fire will not draw aggro from creeps.</li>
			<li>You almost never want to keep Liquid Fire on autocast. When manually casted, you have 600 'cast range,' but
				when on autocast, it uses Jakiro's default 400 attack range. Why? Hell if I know. This game sometimes, I swear.</li>
			<li>Even if your attack misses, Liquid Fire will always apply its effect on the target and the AoE.</li>
			<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Liquid Frost will also apply its effects on the target if the attack misses.</li></ul>
			<li>No one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. You can use
				it preemptively on your high ground if your teammates are dead to kill off the creep wave. It's not a
				big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage pushes.</li>
			<li>Multiple instances of Macropyre do <i>not</i> stack with each other. If you have a Refresher, you're better off
				casting the second Macropyre somewhere else.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The slow on the ice walls from Agh's Scepter Macropyre works on debuff immune enemies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your
				camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases
				dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it or walk into it.</li>
			<li>Jakiro slows attack speed like crazy. Even between a level 1 Liquid Fire and a level 1 Dual Breath, you're losing a ton of attack speed.
				Beware if you like to play aggressive and you're a right clicker.</li>
			<li>When Liquid Fire is off cooldown, the fire head starts glowing with dripping fire and Jakiro will use the
				fire head for all attacks until Liquid Fire is used.</li>
			<li>Don't stand next to your tower when farming under the tower. It's scientifically proven that Jakiro
				players get highly aroused if a single Liquid Fire attack lands on both a hero and a tower.</li>
