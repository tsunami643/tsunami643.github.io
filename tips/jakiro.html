		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Each attack provided by your Double Trouble innate can proc items and counts as an additional hit against things like
				Phoenix's Supernova, Undying's Tombstone, or even enemy wards.</li>
			<li>Dual Breath can hit targets farther than the max cast range of the spell, so stick to ground targeting if you're
				trying to damage an enemy that's escaping. </li>
			<li>If you ground target Dual Breath from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it.
				If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.
				<ul><li>This is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever
					directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed
					through fog.</li></ul>
			<li>When casting Dual Breath, the slow 'ice' breath is released first, then the DoT 'fire' breath shortly after. So be aware
				that an enemy may be able to react to the first Dual Breath and Blink Dagger out.</li>
			<li>Since Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to preemptively disable enemies. This is good
				against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are cycloned, or heroes who are
				TPing in to defend a structure.</li>
			<li>Ice Path gives vision. Use it to scout high ground or the Rosh pit or cliffs when dewarding.</li>
			<li>If you're getting chased by a melee enemy, just cast Ice Path in front of yourself and walk through it.
				Jakiro's turn speed and long cast animations make it easy for an enemy to dodge it if you cast it behind yourself
				when they're so close to you.</li>
			<li>Casting Ice Path on an Aegis reincarnation will instantly stun the enemy when they respawn.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Liquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and can make Jakiro a great pusher.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Try to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly
				change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Manually casting Liquid Fire or Liquid Frost on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>You almost never want to keep Liquid Fire or Liquid Frost on autocast. When manually casted, you have 600 'cast range,' but
				when on autocast, it uses Jakiro's default 400 attack range. Why? Hell if I know. This game sometimes, I swear.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Even if your attack misses, Liquid Fire or Liquid Frost will always apply its effect on the target and the AoE.</li>
			<li>No one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. You can use
				it preemptively on your high ground if your teammates are dead to kill off the creep wave. It's not a
				big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage pushes.</li>
			<li>Multiple instances of Macropyre do <i>not</i> stack with each other. If you have a Refresher, you're better off
				casting the second Macropyre somewhere else.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The slow on the ice walls from Agh's Scepter Macropyre works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your
				camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases
				dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it or walk into it.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>When Liquid Fire or Liquid Frost is off cooldown, the respective head will gain a particle effect. You can use this to passively
				keep track of when he's more eager to try and land an attack on you.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Jakiro slows attack speed like crazy. Even between a level 1 Liquid Fire and a level 1 Dual Breath, you're losing a ton of attack speed.
				Beware if you like to play aggressive and you're a right clicker.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Don't stand next to your tower when farming under the tower. It's scientifically proven that Jakiro
				players get highly aroused if a single Liquid Fire attack lands on both a hero and a tower.</li>
