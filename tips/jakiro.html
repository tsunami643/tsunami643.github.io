		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Dual Breath's cast range is only 550, but it can hit units up to ~1000 units away. The slow 'ice' breath is released first,
				then the DoT 'fire' breath 0.3s later.</li>
			<li>Since Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to pre-emptively disable enemies. This is good
				against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are Tornado'd, or heroes who are
				TPing in who like to immediately Blink after.</li>
			<li>Ice Path gives vision. Use it to scout high ground or the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>If you're getting chased by a melee enemy, just cast Ice Path in front of yourself and walk through it.
				Jakiro's turn speed is terrible and an enemy can very easily dodge it if you cast it behind yourself
				when they're so close to you.</li>
			<li>Liquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and is what makes Jakiro a great pusher. Pay attention to
				when it's off cool down and use it accordingly. This also makes Jakiro a good buddy to have during tower
				dives and solo Rosh attempts.</li>
			<li>Try to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly
				change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.</li>
			<li>You almost never want to keep Liquid Fire on autocast. When manually casted, you have 600 'cast range,' but
				when on autocast, it uses Jakiro's default 400 attack range. Why? Hell if I know. This game sometimes, I swear.</li>
			<li>Also, manually casting Liquid Fire will not draw aggro from creeps.</li>
			<li>No one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. You can use
				it preemptively on your high ground if your teammates are dead to kill off the creep wave. It's not a
				big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage engagements.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your
				camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases
				dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it.</li>
			<li>Jakiro slows attack speed like crazy. With a level 1 Liquid Fire and a level 1 Dual Breath, you're at almost
				-50 attack speed for 5 seconds. Beware if you like to play aggressive and you're a right clicker.</li>
			<li>When Liquid Fire is off cooldown, the fire head starts glowing with dripping fire and Jakiro will use the
				fire head for all attacks until Liquid Fire is used.</li>
			<li>Don't stand next to your tower when farming under the tower. It's scientifically proven that Jakiro
				players get highly aroused if a single Liquid Fire attack lands on both a hero and a tower.</li>
