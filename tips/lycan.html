		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wolves are quite possibly the strongest scouting tool in the game. Once they hit 4 you have two 460 move
				speed, permanently invisible, 55 second observer wards on demand. Use this to scout, check/kill runes,
				block/stack camps, body block targets, and most importantly, follow around high priority targets. If you
				want them to quietly hunt someone, issue a follow command. Press (default) M+left click on a hero. Your
				wolf will tail your target but never attack and break invisibility. However, be aware that when the
				duration of the wolf ends, the enemy hero will suddenly see a wolf keel over and die next to him,
				possibly compromising your sneakiness.</li>
			<li>When jungling or Roshing, you can shake neutral aggro off your wolves the same way you can drop tower
				aggro. Select the wolf in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should start
				focusing another unit.</li>
			<li>Howl is a game changing skill. It's practically a 10 second Demon Edge for your whole team at level 4 at night.
				Pay attention to what your team is doing on the map and use it to help them even if you're not there.</li>
			<li>Don't feed Necronomicon creeps just for a few more seconds of tower damage. They're worth a sizable gold
				and experience bounty.</li>
			<li>Lycan has 1800 night vision when in Shapeshift form.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay attention to when the enemy team is Howl'd. Not only can you not trade hits with them easily, but diving them
				may be tricky with their extra HP.</li>
			<li>While you can't slow him when he's Shapeshifted, mass Eul's is a great way to keep him on lockdown. It's
				cheap enough that most people on your team can build it and it buys time for other stuns to come off
				cooldown.</li>
