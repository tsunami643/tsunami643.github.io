		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wolves are quite possibly the strongest scouting tool in the game. Once they hit level 4 you have two moving,
				permanently invisible, minute long observer wards on demand. Use them to scout, check/kill runes,
				block/stack camps, body block targets, and most importantly, follow around high priority targets. If you
				want them to quietly hunt someone, issue a follow command. Press (default) M+left click on a hero. Your
				wolf will tail your target but never attack and break invisibility. However, be aware that when the
				duration of the wolf ends, the enemy hero will suddenly see a wolf keel over and die next to him,
				possibly compromising your sneakiness.</li>
			<li>When jungling or Roshing, you can shake neutral aggro off your Wolves the same way you can drop tower
				aggro. Select the wolf in question and then a+left click another allied unit and the creeps should start
				focusing another unit.</li>
			<li>Don't feed Necronomicon creeps just for a few more seconds of tower damage. They're worth a sizable gold
				and experience bounty.</li>
			<li>The ranged Necronomicon level 3 creep has the ability to purge. The purge can't be targeted on allies,
				like the ranged Satyr's can, but you can use it to dispel things like enemy self-Eulses, Ghost Scepters, or Aeon Disk procs.
				The purge also slows enemies.
			</li>
			<li>Lycan has 1800 night vision when in Shapeshift form.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Howl can be dispelled.</li>
			<li>While you can't slow him when he's Shapeshifted, mass Eul's is a great way to keep him on lockdown. It's
				cheap enough that most people on your team can build it and it buys time for other stuns to come off
				cooldown.</li>
			<li>Even though Lycan deals damage through many units, Crimson Guard isn't the most effective item against him
				due to Shapeshift's crits. However, he can't crit on buildings, so the active Guard on structures can be useful at
				slowing his push.</li>
			<li>Winter Wyvern's ultimate can be irritating for Lycan to deal with since it turns him into food for all his summons.</li>
