		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid taking traditional ganking routes if possible. You're crazy fast at night
				so you can afford to sacrifice some travel time in order to avoid walking into typically warded areas.</li>
			<li>Use TPs liberally during night time. Show yourself in one lane, then TP to another once the wave dies.
				This makes your ganks far more unpredictable.</li>
			<li>Buy your own wards if you need to. It's much easier for you to place aggressive wards than it is for your
				supports thanks to the speed you have at night time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Night Stalker sees as much at daytime as most heroes see at night. If you see him when the sun's out, remember
				that he only has 800 day vision and may not even know you're there.</li>
			<li>Void doesn't ministun during daytime.</li>
			<li>NS is essentially an M1 Abrams with wings. Dude has extremely high armor with no items. This is what makes him
				such a terrifying tower diver.</li>
			<li>Like against Bounty Hunter, if NS blows his stun early, try to TP out.</li>
			<li>Some heroes also don't mind night time that much. Luna gets bonus night vision with Lunar Blessing, Lycan
				gets bonus night vision in Shapeshift, Slark has 1800 night vision, Sniper has 1400 night vision, and Slardar,
				Spirit Breaker, and Winter Wyvern have night vision talents.</li>
			<li>The Harpy neutrals have 1800 day and night vision.</li>
