		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Void doesn't ministun enemies during daytime, only night.</li>
			<li>You're considered a flying unit during Dark Ascension. Besides the free pathing, this also means you won't trigger Techies
				Proximity Mines and you can freely pass over Mars's Arena walls.</li>
			<li>Avoid taking traditional ganking routes if possible. You're crazy fast at night
				so you can afford to sacrifice some travel time in order to avoid walking into typically warded areas.</li>
			<li>Use TPs liberally during night time. Show yourself in one lane, then TP to another once the wave dies.
				This makes your ganks far more unpredictable.</li>
			<li>Buy your own wards if you need to. It's much easier for you to place aggressive wards than it is for your
				supports thanks to the speed you have at night time.</li>
			<li>The range that most heroes can see during daytime is how far Night Stalker sees during night. Abuse this and sneak around
				enemies who don't know you're spying on them from afar.</li>
			<li>On the flip side, you need to also be acutely aware at how insanely blind you are during daytime. Take a look at your lane creeps when they're moving
				between towers or fighting with no heroes around. You see how awful their vision is? Yeah, that's the same as your day vision.
				If you're trying to get into a gank position before activating Dark Ascension, there's a very real possibility that you'll be clocked by
				some random hero walking around in the area without even knowing. Be especially savvy about utilizing tree fog during daytime.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can eat glyphed lane creeps with Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night. Could be handy to know if an enemy is Boots of Traveling
				onto a creep and activates glyph to protect it.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can grief your teammates by eating their couriers at night with Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night. You can't
				eat donkeys in the fountain, but if they leave that safe zone, it's feeding time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Night Stalker sees as much at daytime as most heroes see at night. If you see him when the sun's out, remember
				that he only has 800 day vision and may not even know you're there.</li>
			<li>Void doesn't ministun during daytime. You can TP out with no fear if NS is chasing you while the sun's out.</li>
			<li>If Night Stalker starts a gank with Void during night time, be aware that he just wasted his only TP cancel.</li>
			<li>NS is essentially an M1 Abrams with wings. Dude has extremely high armor with no items. This is what makes him
				such a terrifying tower diver.</li>
			<li>Raindrops can mitigate a lot of Void damage. Since Night Stalker doesn't really have the mana to spend on frequent Voids,
				Raindrops can significantly reduce NS's deadliness.</li>
			<li>Some heroes also don't mind night time that much. Luna gets bonus night vision with Lunar Blessing, Lycan
				gets bonus night vision in Shapeshift, Slark has 1800 night vision, Sniper has 1400 night vision, Bane has 1200 night vision,
				and Spirit Breaker has a night vision talent.</li>
			<li>Phoenix forces the whole map to daytime during Supernova, even taking priority over Night Stalker's Dark Ascension. This can
				significantly reduce NS's usefulness in team fights.</li>
			<li>Crippling Fear is one of the few silences that Manta Style and other dispels can't get you out of. If you're a hero that relies on
				spells to escape ganks, you'll likely need a BKB or Force Staff to escape the Crippling Fear silence.</li>
