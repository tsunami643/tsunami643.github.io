		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Crystal Nova provides vision around the target radius for ~6 seconds. Useful when trying to deward
				or scout the Rosh pit.
			<ul><li>The vision radius is also waaaay bigger than the actual spell's damage radius (900 ground vision),
				so you can use it to scout across treelines, help get vision of an escaping enemy at night, cast it on
				high ground if an enemy is going up stairs, or keep track of enemy movement during a tier 3 push after
				your creep wave dies.</li></ul>
			<li>Frostbite lasts for 10 seconds on creeps and will do 100 DPS at all levels (WOW THAT'S LIKE 1000
				DAMAGE). This allows you to grab some easy XP or ward money from a large neutral camp as one
				Frostbite+some auto attacks will usually be enough to kill the biggest creep in the camp. Just do your
				team a favor and try to finish the whole camp, though. No one wants your leftovers.</li>
			<li>Try to drag the big creep out of the camp before Frostbiting them. This way you won't draw aggro from
				the other creeps while you're beating on the big one.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Crystal Clone disjoints incoming projectiles.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can use the pushback on Agh's Shard Crystal Clone to travel up and down cliffs.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can cast Agh's Shard Crystal Clone while channeling. Like channeling Freezing Field or a TP.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can detonate your own Agh's Shard Crystal Clone by damaging it with your AoE spells like Crystal Nova or Freezing Field.</li>
			<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9vkCA-6BNME?t=63">Freezing Field has <i>some</i> logic to how its damage is determined.</a> Basically the AoE circle of the spell is divided
				into quadrants and each quadrant is cycled through counterclockwise every 0.1s with the northeast quadrant
				being the first one. <i>In theory,</i> the most reliable way to damage an enemy is to have them standing directly in a
				cardinal direction from your hero so that they're on the line between two quadrants. In practice, this doesn't consistently
				make that big a difference. Overall, it's just a pretty random spell.</li>
			<li>If you're going Battle Maiden, one item of choice is Shadow Blade/Shadow Amulet/Glimmer Cape since you
				can cast the invis while you're channeling your Freezing Field. BKB is also a nice luxury option.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Boots of Bearing, Disperser from allies, and Dark Seer's Surge can allow you to
				temporarily bypass the move speed slow when casting Agh's Scepter Freezing Field.</li>
			<li>A good Freezing Field can often make or break a team fight. You don't have to blow the spell as soon as
				the fight breaks out (unless you want to force the enemy to use their disables on a support). Casting your
				ultimate when the enemy has forgotten about you and once disables are on cooldown could be the key to success.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't underestimate her early game spell damage. If you don't have any stuns/silences, her ult will destroy
				you in a 1v1 support cage match.</li>
			<li>Frostbite is a root which will disable most movement spells (and obviously Blink Dagger). If you're an Anti-Mage or Queen of Pain and CM is
				sauntering towards you, you can be sure that she has backup.</li>
			<li>In matches against CM you'll often find yourself wondering, <i>"How does X have so much mana!?"</i> CM's Arcane Aura
				is why they have so much mana. So don't assume that just because Ancient Apparition used Chilling Touch 3 times at
				level 2 that he's going to stop any time soon.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>A lot of things that you'd think <i>would</i> stop an Agh's Scepter Freezing Field don't.
				Axe's Berserker's Call, Disruptor's Glimpse, Kunkka's X Marks The Spot, and Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap, will no longer
				cancel Freezing Field after CM gets an Agh's Scepter.</li>
