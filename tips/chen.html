		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Penitence works on Roshan.</li>
			<li>Ward-type units (Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards, Witch Doctor's Death Ward, etc) and towers benefit from Penitence attack speed.</li>
			<li>Penitence attack speed is granted at the beginning of an attack on the debuffed target.</li>
			<li>If a creep dies because you Persuaded a new creep past the cap, it does not grant any experience to enemies.</li>
			<li>Learn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which one best matches your playstyle at various points of the game.
				<ul>
					<li>Early game, consider getting the big Ghost for movespeed slow, big Harpy for Chain Lightning nukes, tiny Kobold for the GPM aura,
						or Vhoul Assassin for the HP regen reduction.</li>
					<li>Bear in mind the Vhoul Assassin attacks only reduce HP regeneration, not heals or lifesteal, so it's not <i>that</i> useful after the early game.</li>
					<li>For mid game fights, the blue Centaur or Mud Golems provide useful stuns or the little Troll with its Ensnare. Other options could be the
						goblet Kobold for the movespeed aura or the Dark Troll Summoner for its Skeletons' Rally aura for pushing. Remember that the Skeletons'
						Rally aura buffs damage for <i>all</i> allied creeps/summons/heroes.</li>
					<li>Those spear disarm Kobolds seem pretty silly, but did you know they can disarm <i>towers?</i> That's right, you can even stop a glyphed
						tier 2/3 tower from multishotting if you poke it with the third disarming attack from this little guy.</li>
					<li>The orange Ogre Bruiser stun lasts a long time, but the windup is insane. If you can get some other stun creeps to setup for it, though...</li>
					<li>The Harpy Scout can see into the Rosh pit with its "Take Off" active.</li>
					<li>Late game, the Alpha Wolf can be valuable for the crits and damage aura.</li>
					<li>Situationally, some other creeps can also be useful. The lance Kobold gives you a passive that disarms,
						the easy camp shield Troll gives you a passive that breaks, the small Ghost gives you an undisjointable
						silence, the small white Satyr gives you a purge/dispel that can be cast on enemies and allies, and the small Wolf
						lets you reduce enemy total attack damage. The blue Ogre Ice Armor can be useful defensively. The healing Hill Troll provides a
						Heal Amplification aura which can boost Hand of God on allies.</li>
					<li>The Wildwing Ripper Hurricane ability can let you pull allies out of Faceless Void's Chronosphere and Enigma's Black Hole.
						Doesn't work against Disruptor's Kinetic Field, Mars's Arena, or leashes.</li>
					<li><span class="shard"></span>If you buy Agh's Shard, some ancients worth considering are the small Frostbitten Golem for the
						cooldown reduction aura, big Granite Golem for the max HP aura, or the yellow Thunderhide for the attack speed buff.</li>
					<li><span class="shard"></span>Multiple casts of the Ice Shaman's Icefire Bomb don't stack, they just refresh the debuff.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>When a Mud Golem dies, it will instantly split, but you will still have control of the Shards.
				You can use this to stun an enemy with the Mud Golem, Persuade a lane creep to force the split, and
				then have two more Shard Golem stuns.</li>
			<li>When either of the Hellbears die, they give all allies in an AoE a buff. You can kill them on demand by Persuading a new unit
				once you're at the max amount of Persuaded creeps.</li>
			<li>Persuaded enemy lane creeps will benefit from the Glyph invulnerability.</li>
			<li>When looking around the jungle for useful creeps to take, consider using your courier for vision to help scout out camps.</li>
			<li>Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in
				the lane and try to pick up last hits or send them to neutral camps and start stacking.</li>
			<li>If a unit being teleported under Holy Persuasion takes damage from a player, the teleport will be canceled.</li>
			<li>You can hold ALT to see all your allies current HP under their topbar portraits. Useful if you need to keep your camera on
				one part of the fight, but want to make sure you can time Hand of God if someone's about to die.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through
				his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.</li>
			<li>Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Clinkz's Death Pact, Crystal Maiden's Frostbite,
				Doom's Devour, Enchantress's Enchant, Lifestealer's Infest, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Pudge's Meat Hook, and Witch Doctor's
				Paralyzing Cask are a few specific examples.</li>
			<li>Damaging a unit that's being teleported under Holy Persuasion cancels the teleport.</li>
			<li>Diffusal Blade's active can root creeps.</li>
