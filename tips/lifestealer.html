		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Lifestealer's Feast innate allows him to deny allied creeps at 75% HP instead of the standard 50%.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Debuff immunity, like from Rage, prevents Tormentor damage from reflecting on you.</li>
			<li>You can Infest and Control ancient creeps at the 2nd level of Infest.</li>
			<li>Midasing a creep that has Open Wounds on it will heal you.</li>
			<li>Infesting applies a basic dispel on your hero, except it is a rare dispel which also dispels buffs in addition to
				debuffs. For example, if you activate a rune, you're going to lose its buffs when you Infest an ally.</li>
			<li>Consider Infesting an ally if they're about to die. You give any Infested target a bunch of HP and move speed. Even if you immediately
				pop up, you still give them the burst heal of HP.</li>
			<li>You can toggle your Armlet while TPing.</li>
			<li>Remember to turn on Armlet before picking up Shield or Illusion runes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>OH MASTA, LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPPORTS KITING ME. Ghost Scepter, Force Staff, Blink Dagger, and Shiva's
				Guard are all great pickups against a Lifestealer. As is a TP scroll if he hasn't gotten a Basher yet.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Be aware that Lifestealer can't cast Unfettered while he's silenced, feared, or hexed.
				He can only strong dispel himself under disables like stuns or roots.</li>
			<li>Every initiator becomes twice as fearsome when Lifestealer is out here Infesting his teammates. Storm Spirit, Clockwerk,
				Batrider, Io, Spirit Breaker, Nature's Prophet, etc, are all Mk. IV Lifestealer Bombers.</li>
			<li>Illusions of Lifestealer don't copy his Feast innate buff stacks. If you click on Lifestealer and he doesn't have a number
				on his Feast buff, it's an illusion.</li>
