		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ether Shock can hit secondary units ~400 units further away than its cast range. If an enemy is making a
				run for it and is just out of cast range, cast the Shock on the ranged creep right behind them. Ether Shock
				won't bounce to units that are in fog, however.</li>
			<li>Ether Shock chooses secondary targets in a cone behind the primary target, the cone is 300 radius wide at the
				furthest point. Secondary targets are always the closest available units to the primary target.</li>
			<li>The facts on Hex: Instant cast time, insta-kills illusions, and is super annoying. Spam cast and cancel
				this spell on the enemy team's initiator when you're toeing off. The moment they Blink in and are in
				range, they'll be Rhasta Fried Chicken.</li>
			<li>An enemy will <i>always</i> be able to BKB in-between Shackle and Hex. Lead with Hex during ganks,
				especially since Hex has no cast animation and also has longer range.</li>
			<li>Shackles deals damage in a bunch of tiny instances, making it very effective to burn off things like
				Templar Assassin's Refraction.</li>
			<li>Don't let enemies farm your Wards for free if they win a team fight. It takes 2 attacks from a hero to kill
				a Ward. Select one lone Ward in the back and have it murder its siblings with a deny after one hero attack.</li>
			<li>The Serpent Wards are controllable units. This hero is one of the few 'micro' heroes that box selection
				is encouraged on. Box your Serpents (or double click one, that'll select them all), tell them to stop
				spitting on creeps, and reorient them on the tower that you were trying to kill or on that 1 HP
				Armlet-toggling Lifestealer that inadvertently limped back into your Wards' range.</li>
			<li>You can trap enemies inside your Wards by casting the circle directly onto a hero.</li>
			<li>Serpent Wards have 1200/800 day/night vision.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're Ward trapped, you can Phase through the serpents using Phase Boots or certain invis
				abilities.</li>
			<li>Damage block does <i>not</i> mitigate Serpent Ward damage. All ward-type units ignore damage block.</li>
			<li>Mass Serpent Ward costs a ton of mana, making Rhasta a great candidate for mana burning or
				Pugna Nether Warding against.</li>
			<li>Illusion attacks count as hero attacks against Serpent Wards.</li>
			<li>You can break these cuffs. Always have a stun/silence ready on your team to bail a teammate out from the
				Shackle channel, the disable is insanely long if you can't.</li>
