		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The only reason you shouldn't hero-target Burrowstrike is if you're going for multi-hero stuns or if
				you're trying to achieve a very specific position. Unlike Earth Spike, the bonus range granted by
				skillshotting Burrowstrike is barely anything (~100 units extra).</li>
			<li>The combination of him having no cast times, Burrowstrike being a stunning Force Staff that doesn't
				break trees, zero fade time on Sandstorm, and the fact that Blink Dagger is a core item makes Sand
				King's jukeability extremely potent. Use all of this to your advantage and be unpredictable. Cast
				Sandstorm, but then immediately change directions while you're invisible. Use Burrowstrike+Sandstorm to
				disjoint attacks until your Blink Dagger comes off cooldown. Burrowstrike into the trees and start
				TPing. The only limit is yourself. And your mana.</li>
			<li>You typically want to avoid leveling Caustic Finale early because it pushes the lane unless you're
				against a melee carry, multiple melee heroes, or aggressive pushers. If you are, then definitely level
				it. Then poke every creep in the lane. Then Burrowstrike. Then get kills.</li>
			<li>If you're planning on channeling an Epicenter post-Burrowstrike, aim the Burrowstrike so you end up
				behind the enemy. Not even an instant Hex will be able to cancel it because you'll finish the channel in
				the time they spend turning around to cast the Hex on you.</li>
			<li>If you are going to shift-queue your Blink Dagger after the Epicenter channel, choose your destination
				at the very last second. Things can change in a two second channel time. Positions can move, TPs come
				in, blinks go out, empires fall.</li>
			<li>Veil of Discord is made for this hero. The huge cast range, long debuff duration, and large AoE make it
				the perfect companion for Epicenter.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You really need to have at least one non-targeted Stun or Silence on your team against Sandy Claws.
				Standing around Sandstorm and realizing that absolutely no one on your team can break the channel is
				both frustrating and embarrassing. Sentry Wards will help, but having to throw down a Sentry Ward
				against every Sandstorm will be a massive waste of money.</li>
			<li>You may not be able to stun/silence him out of his Epicenter channel, but you can still disable his
				Blink Dagger with damage. Wasting 2-4 pulses for a 0.1s Illuminate or some other long range spell is a
				great trade.</li>
			<li>Probably the second best hero in the game to get a Pipe against after Zeus.</li>
