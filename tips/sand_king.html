		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The only reason you shouldn't hero target Burrowstrike is if you're going for multi-hero stuns or if
				you're trying to achieve a very specific position. Unlike Earth Spike, the bonus range granted by
				skillshotting Burrowstrike is barely anything (~100 units extra).</li>
			<li>The combination of him having no cast times, Burrowstrike being a stunning Force Staff that doesn't
				break trees, instant fade time on Sand Storm invis, and the fact that Blink Dagger is a core item makes Sand
				King's jukeability extremely potent. Use all of this to your advantage and be unpredictable. Cast
				Sand Storm, but then immediately change directions while you're invisible. Use Sand Storm to
				disjoint attacks until your Blink Dagger comes off cooldown. Burrowstrike into the trees and start
				TPing. The only limit is yourself. And your mana.</li>
			<li>Casting Burrowstrike on a Lotus Orbed target will have you swap positions with the enemy while stunning them on
				the way. If you skillshot the Burrowstrike in a way that you only hit the enemy with the edge of the stun AoE,
				the reflected enemy Burrowstrike may not even stun you back.</li>
			<li>Linken's Sphere will always block Burrowstrike regardless of how you targeted it.</li>
			<li>Attacking or casting an item/spell while in the Sand Storm AoE will temporarily reveal you for a brief period of time,
				but you'll go back invis after.</li>
			<li>If you're planning on channeling an Epicenter post-Burrowstrike, aim the Burrowstrike so you end up
				behind the enemy. Not even an instant hex will be able to cancel it because you'll finish the channel in
				the time they spend turning around to cast the hex on you.</li>
			<li>If you are going to shift-queue your Blink Dagger after the Epicenter channel, choose your destination
				at the very last second. Things can change in a two second channel time. Positions can move, TPs come
				in, Blinks go out, empires fall.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>A value Dust or sentry ward can go a long way against a Sand King who's always sitting around in their
				Sand Storm.</li>
			<li>Sand King cannot Burrowstrike when rooted.</li>
			<li>Caustic Finale won't trigger if a unit is denied.</li>
			<li>You may not be able to stun/silence him out of his Epicenter channel, but you can still disable his
				Blink Dagger with damage. Making him waste 2-4 Epi pulses for a 0.1s Powershot or some other long range spell is a
				great trade.</li>
