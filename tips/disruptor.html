		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Count down your Glimpses. Glimpse is an incredibly powerful spell, but only if used intelligently.
				Glimpse will always revert someone to where they were 4 seconds prior. So as soon as you see someone out
				of position, remember where they were and start counting to four. Watch where the end location dot is
				and cast a Field around it.</li>
			<li>One method to timing Glimpses is by casting a Thunder Strike on your target. The third Strike connects
				four seconds after the spell was cast. Plus, Thunder Strike gives you vision of your target.</li>
			<li>Glimpse will break any enemy channels on cast.</li>
			<li>Glimpse instantly kills illusions, but not 'strong' illusions.</li>
			<li>Try getting wards/vision behind towers when pushing. Players will often TP to the rear of a tower and linger
				there for >4 seconds so they don't get insta-Glimpsed. Spot them and send then from whence they came.</li>
			<li>Kinetic Field provides vision inside the circle, allowing you to scout Rosh, trees, or high ground from
				long range. This is also useful for dewarding cliffs.</li>
			<li>The outside of Kinetic Field is just as useful as the inside. Don't be afraid to block someone on the
				outside with the edge rather than lock them in.</li>
			<li>Allies with spells that apply forced movement, like Drow Ranger's Gust or Mars's Spear,
				can potentially push enemies out of your Kinetic Field.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Static Storm can mute enemies who are Cycloned so that when they land, they can't activate anything.
				However, hides/banishes will not mute enemies and they will be able to activate items/spells upon emerging
				from the banish.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TP behind trees or even one tier back if you're defending a push against Disruptor unless you like
				wasting gold. Glimpse will also be a real pain if you're an Io, Nature's Prophet, Spectre, or
				Tinker.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the AoE of the Static Storm. Often times Disruptors will cast half of it within the
				Kinetic Field and the other half outside. Stop running against the wall of the Field and sitting in the
				Storm if you don't have to.</li>
			<li>Kinetic Field provides vision in the middle of the Field, but not actually around the wall. If you're trying to
				escape in trees and you see a Field forming, you're actually the least visible if you touch the wall.</li>
			<li>Most spells that provide <a href="http://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_Movement">forced movement</a> can allow a hero to move through a Field.</li>
			<li>Some forced movement <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Trap#Forced_Movement_Disabling"><i>does not</i> let you pass through Kinetic Field:</a>
				Dawnbreaker's Starbreaker, Magnus's Skewer, Mirana's Leap, Monkey King's Tree Dance or Primal Spring, Phoenix's Sun Ray, Slark's Pounce, Snapfire's Firesnap Cookie,
				and Force Staff/Hurricane Pike don't work.</li>
			<li>Spells that provide flying movement or unobstructed movement do not allow a hero to pass through Kinetic Field
				either.</li>
			<li>Planting an Iron Branch can let you escape a Kinetic Field. To perform this trick, 
				get your hero to push against the edge of the Field, then cast the Branch behind your hero, but inside your hero's white selection circle.
				<a href="https://youtu.be/C-573mQSYNI?t=9">The resulting tree may shove you out of the Field.</a> This trick also works against
				Slark's Pounce leash.</li>
			<li>The reason Iron Branch can push you out of a Kinetic Field is because the tree has collision. That means spells
				that create collision, like Tusk's Ice Shards or a well angled Earthshaker Fissure, can also push a hero out.</li>
			<li>Other repositioning effects can also provide a Kinetic Field escape. Like getting kicked by an Earth Spirit Boulder Smash, getting
				Meat Hooked by Pudge, or even a lucky Manta Style rearrangement.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit can also Rolling Boulder in/out of a Kinetic Field and Geomagnetic Grip allies out with the "Geomagnetic Grip Targets Allies"
				talent.</li>
			<li>Wind Waker movement can get you out of a Kinetic Field.</li>
			<li>Spell immunity or banishes are the only ways to "dodge" Glimpses. Eul's doesn't work (Cyclone gets canceled) and most forced movement
				spells get canceled by Glimpse. The only exceptions are banishes like Lifestealer's Infest, Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment,
				Puck's Phase Shift, Shadow Demon's Disruption, Tusk's Snowball, or even a Manta Style activation.
				Certain un-interruptable position changing spells like Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist and Activate Fire Remnant, Phantom Lancer's Doppelganger,
				Sand King's Burrowstrike, and Void Spirit's Dissimilate can also dodge Glimpse relocation.</li>
			<li>A Hood or Pipe can save you from the Glimpse+Static Storm combo if you have a Blink Dagger. Putting up the Barrier
				will eat the first few instances of Static Storm damage, potentially buying you enough time to Blink out.</li>
			<li>Kunkka is a sleeper counterpick to Disruptor since you can X Marks an ally who's getting Glimpsed to save
				them from being repositioned.</li>
			<li>If Disruptor is spamming Thunder Strike on you in lane, consider standing next to your ranged creep to make it take damage and
				bring it into deny range.</li>
