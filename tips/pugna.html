		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nether Blast damages towers and creeps. You don't get bonus damage for engulfing the whole tower,
				which is what some Pugnas seem to think. Keep the tower on the edge of the Blast AoE and focus the
				majority of the Blast on the creep wave.</li>
			<li>Nether Blast is an great spell to cast and stop-cancel. The animation is extremely obvious, but the lack
				of any visual feedback makes it difficult for the enemy to tell if you canceled it or not. Eventually
				they'll call your bluff, at which point you can start getting lazy with your Stop key.</li>
			<li>You can Decrepify the Nether Ward, effectively making it invulnerable for a few seconds. You can also Decrepify
				Undying's Tombstone.</li>
			<li>Check yourself before you Decrep yourself. In a 1v1 situation you usually want to Decrep the enemy, when
				there are multiple enemies you usually want to Decrep yourself, when there is a team fight, you should
				try to save your Decrep for your Nether Ward.</li>
			<li>Decrepify makes you immune to physical damage even from spells, such as Jugg's Omnislash or Dazzle's
				Shadow Wave.</li>
			<li>Lane and neutral creeps will immediately drop aggro if you are Decrepified. If you're sneaking behind
				enemy lines and a creep is following you, Decrepify yourself and it'll lose interest.
			<li>This is also extremely useful for tower dives if you're willing to risk amplified magic damage, since both
				the tower and creeps will ignore you.</li>
			<li>Decrepify slows enemies, but not allies.</li>
			<li>Nether Ward's mana degen is significant, especially in lane. Find a nice cozy place to hide it and revel
				in how huge a 1600 radius is.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens is pretty cute on Pugna since it allows you to dump your Nether Ward inside trees.</li>
			<li>Life Drain creeps to heal yourself up after a team fight. Don't bother trying to regen mana from creeps
				though, that part only works on hero targets.</li>
			<li>Life Drain provides true sight on targets.</li>
			<li>Life Drain kills illusions on the first tick.</li>
			<li>You can target Life Drain on allies to heal their HP (or mana) at the cost of your own HP.</li>
			<li>HP transferred by Life Drain is calculated after all reductions. If the enemy has magic resistance
				then you'll heal less per tick and if you have magic resistance you'll heal allies less per tick.</li>
			<li>Since Life Drain works on non-hero units, you can deny yourself in a pinch by Life Draining yourself
				into an allied creep.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pugna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game. While he may appear squishy, it's tough for
				a bootless support to get a lock on him because he's so fast.</li>
			<li>The Nether Ward will toast you before your spell comes out. The spell won't be put on cooldown if you
				die, though.</li>
			<li>If you're in the Nether Ward's AoE, you will see a debuff icon in your status bar.</li>
			<li>Pipe of Insight's Barrier works on buildings.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel is a great way to make Life Drain easier to deal with when against a farmed Pugna since
				he'll heal much less.</li>
