		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're trading hits frequently in lane, focus your points in Corrosive Skin rather than your orb.
				Corrosive actually deals more DoT (40/60/80/100) than Poison Attack (20/32/44/56).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>For the first 25 minutes of the game you're not going to get away from Viper and you're not going to win
				a manfight against him. Shrug your shoulders, pack your bags up, and start TPing as soon as the first
				orb hits you.</li>
			<li>You want to avoid putting DoTs on Viper. Every time he takes damage, Corrosive Skin will refresh on your
				hero if you're in 1400 range. Seeing as how Corrosive Skin is also giving him magic resistance, he'll
				typically take less damage than you from any DoT.</li>
			<li>THIS INCLUDES RADIANCE. OH GOD NEVER BUILD A RADIANCE AGAINST VIPER.</li>
			<li>Rubick is guaranteed to always steal Viper's ult.</li>
