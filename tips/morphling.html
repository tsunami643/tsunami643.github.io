		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Waveform to travel between and damage two jungle camps at the same time.</li>
			<li>Waveform can be used to absorb certain projectiles headfirst since you are invulnerable during the
				spell.</li>
			<li>When using Waveform to push the lane, move near the ranged creep in the enemy wave and Waveform in
				towards your creeps. You make yourself vulnerable to ganks when you Waveform deeper into enemy territory.</li>
			<li>When one Adaptive Strike is cast, the other goes into cooldown for 3 seconds.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Attribute Shift while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>I know you come to these tips because you don't want to read a lot of things, but if you <i>are</i> willing to
				spend a little more brain power learning about Dota, I highly recommend studying the following post explaining how
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8f5mtp/attribute_shift_misconceptions_about_the_spell/">
				HP gain from Attribute Shift can be properly exploited.</a></li>
			<li>Casting Morph applies a basic dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li>After shotgunning a target, they may still have some HP left over once you're out of spell damage. However, you
				can try Morphing into your target and finishing them off with whatever magic damage spells they have.
			</li>
			<li>Mechanics on Morphs:
				<ul>
				<li>Morphs take the target hero's base STR, AGI, INT, primary attribute, level, range, and movespeed on cast. You do not
					get the hero's base armor, base damage, BAT, missile speed, or talents.</li>
				<li>Morphs will keep Morphling's items and you can use them normally as the Morphed hero.</li>
				<li>Morphs copy the current <i>percentage</i> of HP/Mana on Morphling when cast.</li>
				<li>Your Morph and your hero independently maintain their own separate HP/Mana pools as you toggle back and forth.</li>
				<li>If you make a Morph of a target that has an Agh's granted basic spell (Treant Protector's Eyes in the Forest or Zeus's Nimbus,
					for example) then your Morph will have that spell as well if the target has their Scepter. However, if you Morph out of that hero
					the Scepter spell will stop working.</li>
				<li>Activating a Manta Style or illusion rune as another hero will generate illusions of that hero and keep them even after morphing back.</li>
				<li>If you generate self-illusions using Naga's Mirror Image or Shadow Demon's Disruption, you can shift+queue Morph after casting those spells
					to create Morphling illusions.</li>
				<li>Morphs spawn with a full set of Stone Remnant, Leap, and Shrapnel charges, but only one Spirit Siphon charge and two Spin Web
					charges.</li>
				<li>If your target hero gets 'new spells' or levels up their own spells, you can refresh your Morph's spells by toggling in and out of
					the Morph. This is mainly relevant if you Morph an Invoker since you can get new Invoker spells whenever he Invokes them.</li>
				<li>Toggling out of a Morph behaves the same way as Rubick's Spell Steal timing out in terms of buffs/spells/summons lingering.</li>
				<li>Activating Terrorblade's Metamorphosis while Morphed only affects your Morph during the initial period. Toggling back to Morphling won't
					preserve the bonus damage or attack range or even the Aura for illusions, all it does is give Morphling a slower attack projectile.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Morphling cannot Waveform when rooted.</li>
			<li>You need to have nukes if you want to kill Morphling. With STR Attribute Shift, he can usually gain HP faster than you can
				burn him down with auto attacks.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel substantially reduces the HP Morphling will gain when STR shifting.</li>
			<li>Silences, stuns, taunts, fears, and hexes are all good ways to prevent Morphling from starting to Attribute Shift.
				They also prevent him from being able to un-Morph himself if he's cosplaying another hero.</li>
			<li>You can see how much time Morphling has left in a Morph by clicking it and checking the buff timer.</li>
			<li>The level number shown next to a Morph's HP is the same level as the real Morphling, not the same level as the hero
				Morphed.</li>
