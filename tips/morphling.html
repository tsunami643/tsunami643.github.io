		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Waveform to travel between and damage two jungle camps at the same time.</li>
			<li>You're invulnerable during Waveform. You can use this to run head first into spell projectiles like
				Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to absorb the stun or just dodge any other damage instances while Waveforming.</li>
			<li>The "Waveform Attacks Targets" talent ignores disarms.</li>
			<li>When one Adaptive Strike is cast, the other goes into cooldown for 3 seconds.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Attribute Shift while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>I know you come to these tips because you don't want to read a lot of things, but if you <i>are</i> willing to
				spend a little more brain power learning about Dota, I highly recommend studying the following post explaining how
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8f5mtp/attribute_shift_misconceptions_about_the_spell/">
				HP gain from Attribute Shift can be properly exploited.</a></li>
			<li>After shotgunning a target with E-Blade, they may still have some HP left over once you're out of spell damage. Since you can't right click them
				until the ethereal form ends, you can try Morphing into your target and finishing them off with whatever magic damage spells they have.
			</li>
			<li>Mechanics on Morphs:
				<ul>
				<li>Morphs take the target hero's base STR, AGI, INT, primary attribute, level, range, and movespeed on cast. You do not
					get the hero's base armor, base damage, BAT, missile speed, or talents.</li>
				<li>Morphs will keep Morphling's items and you can use them normally as the Morphed hero.</li>
				<li>Morphs copy the current <i>percentage</i> of HP/Mana on Morphling when cast.</li>
				<li>Spells and items cost 50% less mana as a Morphed hero.</li>
				<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you Morph into a hero that has an Agh's Scepter granted basic spell (like Keeper of the Light's Will-O-Wisp or Zeus's Nimbus,
					for example) then your Morph will have that spell as well if the target has their Agh's Scepter equipped. If the Agh's Scepter spell depends on another
					spell from that hero, it'll only work while you're Morphed. For example, Nimbus needs you to be in Zeus form for the Lightning Bolts to work.</li>
				<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you have an Agh's Scepter <i>as</i> Morphling, any basic spells will be upgraded accordingly from your Morphed target. However,
					new spells (like Nimbus) won't be granted.</li>
				<li><span class="shard"></span>The prior two rules are also true of Agh's Shard upgrades. If you have an Agh's Shard equipped,
					it'll upgrade any corresponding spells. If your target has an Agh's Shard equipped, you get the new basic spell if they have one.
					If the spell depends on any other aspects of that hero, you need to stay in that hero's form for the spell to work.</li>
				<li>Toggling out of a Morph behaves the same way as Rubick's Spell Steal timing out in terms of buffs/spells/summons lingering.</li>
				<li>You can activate Sand Storm as Sand King and then Morph out but still keep the Sand Storm buff as long as you remain in the AoE.</li>
				<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you die in Vengeful Spirit's form while you have an Agh's Scepter, you will turn into a Venge illusion
					when you die. You'll also take that illusion's place when you respawn as Morphling.</li>
				<li>Activating a Manta Style or illusion rune as another hero will generate illusions of that hero and keep them even after morphing back.</li>
				<li>If you generate self-illusions using Naga's Mirror Image or Shadow Demon's Disruption, you can shift+queue Morph after casting those spells
					to create Morphling illusions.</li>
				<li>Morphs spawn with a full set of charges for any charge based spell.</li>
				<li>If your target hero gets 'new spells' or levels up their own spells, you can refresh your Morph's spells by toggling in and out of
					the Morph. This is mainly relevant if you Morph an Invoker since you can get new Invoker spells whenever he Invokes them.</li>
				<li>Activating Terrorblade's Metamorphosis while Morphed only affects your Morph during the initial period. Toggling back to Morphling won't
					preserve the bonus damage or attack range or even the Aura for illusions.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Morphling cannot Waveform when rooted.</li>
			<li>You need to have nukes if you want to kill Morphling. With STR Attribute Shift, he can usually gain HP faster than you can
				burn him down with auto attacks.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel substantially reduces the HP Morphling will gain when STR shifting. As do Skadi and Shiva's.</li>
			<li>Bane's Enfeeble reduces health restoration. Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast completely prevents health restoration.</li>
			<li>Silences, stuns, taunts, fears, and hexes are all good ways to prevent Morphling from starting to Attribute Shift.
				They also prevent him from being able to un-Morph himself if he's cosplaying another hero.</li>
			<li>You can see how much time Morphling has left in a Morph by clicking it and checking the buff timer.</li>
			<li>The level number shown next to a Morph's HP is the same level as the real Morphling, not the same level as the hero
				Morphed.</li>
