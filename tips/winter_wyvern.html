		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Arctic Burn's DoT can only be applied once per enemy per cast and multiple attacks on the same target <i>do not</i>
				refresh the debuff. Spread your damage out between enemies when in Arctic Burn and pay attention to the buff timer
				in your status bar to maximize your damage.
				<ul><li><span class="scepter"></span>With Agh's Scepter, multiple Arctic Burn attacks on the same hero <i>do</i> refresh the debuff.</li></ul>
			<li>Arctic Burn's DoT deals a percentage of the target's current HP as magic damage. Your ideal targets are heroes
				who have the highest <i>current</i> HP, not max HP.
				<ul>
					<li>As a result, the DoT can never kill an enemy. Some asymptotic damage up in this bitch.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>When in Arctic Burn, Winter Wyvern can't uphill miss on units or structures. Because she's flying. A rare instance of Dota
				following logic.</li>
			<li>Respect the buffed night vision when in Arctic Burn. You don't get flying vision, but you can use the bonus sight
				to scout very well if you travel onto a cliff.</li>
			<li>The primary target of Splinter Blast <i>does not take damage</i>. I know you're really angry that QoP just
				Blinked away with 20 HP, but Splinter Blasting her does absolutely nothing. You're better off holding on to the cooldown
				in case the enemy walks into a creepwave or near some neutrals.
			<ul><li>Having said that, Splinter Blast is actually a dope Linken's popper because the range is ludicrous.</li></ul>
			<li>Splinter Blast's secondary projectiles can hit invis and fogged units.</li>
			<li>Cold Embrace the creep that's tanking tower shots when pushing; ideally when they're almost dead so they'll heal too.</li>
			<li>Cold Embrace protects units from <i>all</i> physical damage, including damage from spells like Death Prophet's Exorcism or Bristleback's
				Quill Spray.</li>
			<li>Winter's Curse provides true sight on the primary target.</li>
			<li>Winter's Curse applies a dispel on the primary target on cast. This is a rare example of a dispel that can pierce debuff immunity/BKB.</li>
			<li>Debuff immune enemies <i>can</i> be Winter's Cursed if they're the primary target. However, debuff immune enemies 
				<i>will not</i> be taunted into attacking an ally who's Cursed.</li>
			<li>Winter's Curse taunts in the AoE for the full duration of the spell and is sticky on the Cursed unit. You can Force Staff
				a Cursed enemy to catch fresh enemies or to drag taunted enemies deeper into your territory.</li>
			<li>Winter's Curse lasts for a shortened duration if there are no targets taunted into attacking the primary Cursed enemy.
				<ul>
				<li>Neutral creeps don't get taunted into attacking a Winter's Cursed enemy, but if they're in the AoE of the spell, 
					you'll get the full Curse duration. Roshan and Tormentors count as a neutrals.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Winter's Curse can be cast on <i>all</i> enemy units, including creeps or summons. The situations in which this could be
				useful are far and few between, but you could use this to catch enemies who play it fast and loose with Blink Daggers (like Puck or
				Tinker) by Cursing a creep that's close to where the enemy will be. Or use it to bypass a Linken's Sphere if you just need a quick disable.
				<ul><li>Casting Winter's Curse on neutral creeps won't taunt enemies. You'll just force some neutrals to murder one of their kin for no reason.</li>
					<li>Winter's Curse can be cast on Roshan and Tormentors, but as with other neutrals it won't taunt any enemies. It does make the
						target only damageable by Wyvern, though.</li></ul>
			<li>Wyvern and any units she owns can damage Winter's Cursed enemies but <i>only</i> with magical or pure damage. Physical damage, like from attacks,
				won't damage Cursed enemies.
				<ul><li>I guess technically your attacks can go through if you're using Revenant's Brooch.</li></ul>
			<li>Allies cannot damage any enemies under Winter's Curse. Neither primary nor secondary Cursed targets.
			<ul><li>However, allies can still apply debuffs to Cursed enemies. Like stun/silence them, or apply DoTs, 
				or build passive stacks (Ursa Fury Swipes, Monkey King Jingu Mastery, etc), or burn their mana.</li>
			<li>Your team can damage an enemy under Winter's Curse (for a percentage of damage) <i>if</i> the target is affected by Undying's
				Flesh Golem damage amplification attack debuff.</li></ul>
			<li>Most item/spell passives and attack modifiers are coded to <i>not</i> work on allies, so don't rely on an enemy critting or mana burning an ally under
				Curse to get a kill. There are a few exceptions: Slark's Essence Shift, Sniper's Headshot, and Basher/Abyssal bashes will work on allies.
				<ul><li>Muerta's Gunslinger <i>technically</i> works on allies but only if there are no other targets for her to Gunsling onto.
					If any other target is nearby, she'll start Slinging onto it instead of the Cursed target.</li></ul>
			<li>Be sure to apply damage to any slippery targets in the Curse with a Splinter Blast before the Curse ends to make sure they don't Blink out. Remember,
				only you can deal damage to the Cursed targets, not your allies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cold Embrace allows for a lot of easy setups for delayed/skillshot spells. Dumb Wyverns will often Embrace allies when they're
				in clear vision, so try to take advantage of the situation.</li>
			<li>Revenant's Brooch turns right clicks into magic damage allowing you to penetrate Cold Embrace.</li>
			<li>You can continue building 'stacks' on an Embraced enemy with spells like Slark's Essence Shift, Bristleback's
				Quill Spray, Ursa's Fury Swipes, etc.</li>
			<li>Don't walk into a Cursed ally. Think of the big snowflakey area like a Chronosphere because you <i>will</i> get sucked into
				fighting your teammate.</li>
			<li>Ethereal Blade or Wind Waker can be used to protect a Cursed target from getting right clicked to death by allies.
				<ul><li>Pugna's Decrepify could also work.</li></ul>
		</ul>
