		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>An interesting quirk (bug) of the "Irrepressible" facet is that you're able to cast spells
				while flying around in your Wind Waker. Not Eul's, though, only Wind Waker.</li>
			<li>Arcane Curse's duration pauses on all silence debuffs, not just ones applied by Silencer himself.</li>
			<li>Manually casting Glaives of Wisdom on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.</li>
			<li>Much like with Undying's Tombstone, you don't want to use Global Silence and then have the enemy team walk
				away until the spell wears off. Silencer's job is rarely to start fights, he's there to
				<a href="https://howdoiplay.com/meepmerp/#silence">SILESILESILENCSILENCSILENCSILSILSSILSILENCE</a> fights that are on the cusp of breaking out.
				You usually want to cast Global Silence soon after your initiator goes in or as soon as your team gets initiated on. It's okay to let a spell or
				two leak through at the beginning if it means that the enemy is committing to the fight. The goal is to
				hit them with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3">4'33"</a> right when they're at the point-of-no-return in the team fight.</li>
			<li>You can save Global Silence to break channeling ults as well (Enigma's Black Hole, Bane's Fiend's Grip, Witch Doctor's Death Ward, Crystal Maiden's Freezing Field), but
				often times it's better to stop them from using their spells altogether by preemptively silencing than
				to risk getting disabled while they're channeling.</li>
			<li>If you're past the phase when huge 5v5 team fights are being decided by a single ultimate, save your ult
				until after BKBs get popped. If you Global Silence while an enemy is debuff immune/BKB'd, they'll get silenced.
				If you do it before they go debuff immune, they can dispel the silence by activating BKB.
				<ul><li><span class="facet"></span>If you take the "Reverberating Silence" facet, a second debuff immune piercing silence will apply
				if the enemy dispels Global Silence.</li></ul>
			<li>Heroes that are <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Hide">hidden</a> (Puck Phase Shift, Outworld Devourer Astral Imprisonment,
				Shadow Demon Disruption, other banishes) <i>will not</i> be affected by Global Silence. Global Silence <i>will</i> affect enemies that are invulnerable or cycloned,
				however, since they're still technically on the map.</li>
			<li>Enemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced. If they've already started channeling, however,
				a silence won't stop them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid trading kills with this hero because the permanent INT steal on kills from his Brain Drain innate adds up quickly.</li>
			<li>Because Silencer takes your INT with Glaives, mana consumables are more effective. If you've got a few stacks of INT stolen,
				that's the best time to eat a Mango, use a Bottle, or activate a Stick.</li>
			<li>You can dispel the Glaive stack counter off your hero at any time before the silence kicks in.</li>
			<li>Save your BKB for after Global Silence is cast. If Global is cast <i>while</i> you're debuff immune/BKB'd, you'll
				still get silenced. If you go debuff immune <i>after</i> Global comes out, the silence is dispelled.
				<ul><li>Eul's is a cheap, but effective, way of dispelling Global Silence. Lotus Orb, Manta Style, Disperser, Satanic, and Guardian
					Greaves are also basic dispels that can remove the silence.</li>
					<li><span class="facet"></span>However, if Silencer has taken his "Reverberating Silence" facet, you'll get silenced again
					after dispelling Global Silence the first time.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>Silencer's "Irrepressible" facet makes him immune to silences.</li>
