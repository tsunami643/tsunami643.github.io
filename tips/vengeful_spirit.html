		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive
				range+vision.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror damage can cancel consumable regen like Salves or Clarities from long range. It's also useful at breaking
				Blink Daggers from long range.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror works on Roshan.</li>
			<li>When you're going for a sneaky Rosh, try to use Wave at such an angle that it won't show up under potential
				enemy vision.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Wave of Terror reduces damage on every unit it hits. However, Venge
				only <i>steals</i> damage and armor from heroes and clones.</li>
			<li>Vlad's can be a worthwhile pickup on VS because between Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura you're a huge bonus
				damage providing hero.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura boosts damage on player controlled units.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>When you die with Agh's Scepter, your Vengeance illusion spawns with
				its spell cooldowns immediately available.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Your Agh's Scepter Vengeance illusion may be a 'strong' illusion, but it's still an illusion.
				This means it deals reduced damage versus buildings and Roshan, it can't copy a lot of attack modifiers, it doesn't benefit
				from + raw armor items, and it doesn't benefit from + raw damage items. You don't even get the benefit of Vengeance Aura damage
				because Vengeance Aura provides + green damage.</li>
			<li>Nether Swap goes through spell immunity, invulnerability, and sleeps.</li>
			<li>Being able to Nether Swap invulnerable units means you can Swap heroes that are cycloned or things like Storm Spirits inside
				Ball Lightning.</li>
			<li>If you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can
				use Swap to break Black Hole.</li>
			<li>If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Nether Swap by clicking on
				the allied hero's portrait in the top bar. You can't target <i>enemies</i> using topbar portraits, however.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape can be a powerful pickup on VS since you can invisibly get into position to Swap, Swap a
				hero, and then fade out again.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens can be incredibly valuable for boosting Nether Swap's range.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is basically an AoE Medallion once maxed. This means that it's very easy for VS's team to
				take Rosh early and it means that tower diving a VS can be very dangerous.</li>
			<li>During tier 3 tower defenses, make sure that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground otherwise someone
				is almost certainly going to get Swapped to the low ground.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura is granted by illusions of VS. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take
				advantage of this.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura can be disabled by Breaks.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Venge's Agh's Scepter death illusion is considered a 'strong' illusion and <i>cannot</i>
				be instagibbed by things like Lion's Mana Drain, hexes, or Dagon.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Brewmaster's Primal Split Storm Panda can deal a lot of damage to illusions, even 'strong' illusions,
				with the Dispel Magic spell.</li>
