		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive
				range+vision.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror can disable Blink Daggers from a massive distance.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror works on Roshan.</li>
			<li>When you're going for a sneaky Rosh, try to use Wave at such an angle that it won't show up under potential
				enemy vision.</li>
			<li>Siege creeps can outrange towers with the extra range provided by Vengeance Aura.</li>
			<li>Don't toss your Vengeance illusion's life away just because you're mad you died. Illusions carry all auras
				that heroes do, so you're still helping your team just by standing near them.</li>
			<li>When you die with the "Vengeance Aura Illusion Casts Spells" talent, the illusion spawns with
				its spell cooldowns immediately available.</li>
			<li>Vlad's can be a worthwhile pickup on VS because between Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura you're a huge bonus
				damage providing hero.</li>
			<li>Nether Swap goes through spell immunity and invulnerability.</li>
			<li>Being able to Nether Swap invulnerable units means you can Swap heroes that are cycloned.</li>
			<li>When Swapping to initiate on an enemy with Blink Dagger, cast Wave on them first to preemptively cancel
				their retreat Blink.</li>
			<li>If you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can
				use Swap to break Black Hole.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape can be a powerful pickup on VS since you can invisibly get into position to Swap, Swap a
				hero, and then fade out again.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens can be incredibly valuable for boosting Nether Swap's range.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is basically an AoE Medallion once maxed. This means that it's very easy for VS's team to
				take Rosh early and it means that tower diving a VS can be very dangerous.</li>
			<li>During tier 3 tower defenses, make sure that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground otherwise someone
				is almost certainly going to get Swapped to the low ground.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura is granted by illusions of VS. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take
				advantage of this.</li>
			<li>Enchantress can Enchant the Vengeance Illusion, however it'll time out whenever VS respawns.</li>
		</ul>
