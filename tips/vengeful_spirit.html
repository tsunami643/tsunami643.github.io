		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive
				range+vision.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror can disable Blink Daggers from a massive distance.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror works on Roshan.</li>
			<li>When you're going for a sneaky Rosh, try to use Wave at such an angle that it won't show up under potential
				enemy vision.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not green/raw +damage items.</li>
			<li>Vlad's can be a worthwhile pickup on VS because between Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura you're a huge bonus
				damage providing hero.</li>
			<li>Don't toss your Vengeance illusion's life away just because you're mad you died. Illusions carry all auras
				that heroes do, so you're still helping your team just by standing near them.</li>
			<li>When you die with an Agh's, your Vengeance illusion spawns with its spell cooldowns available.</li>
			<li>Nether Swap goes through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Nether Swap can pop Linken's Sphere without consuming any Swap charges, however the spell will still consume mana.</li>
			<li>When Swapping to initiate on an enemy with Blink Dagger, cast Wave on them first to preemptively cancel
				their retreat Blink.</li>
			<li>If you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can
				use Swap to break Black Hole.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape can be a powerful pickup on VS since you can invisibly get into position to Swap, Swap a
				hero, and then fade out again.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens can be incredibly valuable for boosting Nether Swap's range.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is basically an AoE Medallion once maxed. This means that it's very easy for VS's team to
				take Rosh early and it means that tower diving a VS can be very dangerous.</li>
			<li>When you're 20 minutes in on a terrible game and you're trying to make yourself feel better by asking,
				"Who has the better late game?" The answer is typically the team with VS on it. Vengeance Aura gets
				stronger as most carries get stronger.</li>
			<li>During T3 tower defenses, make sure that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground otherwise someone
				is almost certainly going to get Swapped to the low ground.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura is granted by illusions of VS. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take
				advantage of this.</li>
			<li>Vengeful's Vengeance illusion can be instakilled like any other illusion (Mana Drain, Hexes, Dagon, etc.). Enchantress can also
				Enchant it, however it'll time out whenever VS respawns.</li>
