		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Diffusal Blade mana burn does not stack with Anti-Mage's Mana Break. All other on-hit effects work, though.</li>
			<li>Blink into the trees! If you're getting ganked, always assume that there is someone behind you, waiting
				for you to Blink back into the lane/jungle to retreat. You have a stupid low cooldown on Blink. Blink
				into an isolated patch of trees, then watch four heroes suddenly materialize from the fog struggling to find you, then quietly
				continue Blinking along the treeline until you're sure you're safe.</li>
			<li>Left click on an enemy hero to check their mana pool before Mana Voiding them. You may be able to
				get a kill without doing any right clicking if you show up at the right time.</li>
			<li>Mana Void comes with a free ministun that penetrates spell immunity. Don't keep slicing at people if you
				see them channeling something, just cancel it.</li>
			<li>Even if the primary target is spell immune, Mana Void area damage still works. If Storm Spirit burns
				himself dry and then BKBs to walk out, he's still a good target if he walks near his team.</li>
			<li>While it's often tempting to spend Mana Void as a baller finishing move on a pick-off target, know that it's really not
				meant to be used like Culling Blade. The AoE damage can be significant when used on a out-of-mana target with a large mana pool
				and you never know if you may need the stun later in a fight.</li>
			<li>That being said, it's okay for you to steal kills with Mana Void in the early/mid game. You do more with the gold than anyone else
				at that stage. The <i>typical Anti-Mage teamfight contribution</i> is a two way street.</li>
			<li>Counterspell prevents single targeted spells from affecting you and it reflects the spell back at the original caster. All Linken's and
				Lotus Orb interactions are consistent with Counterspell's behavior. There are a few unique interactions to note, however:</li>
				<ul>
			<li>Certain spells can only be reflected by Counterspell on cast and don't do anything on projectile impact. Notable examples
				include Dazzle's Poison Touch and Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace.</li>
			<li>Riki's Blink Strike and Phantom Assassin's Phantom Strike will be 'absorbed' by Counterspell. So their spell will go on cooldown
				and they won't come to you, but you won't reflect back to them.</li>
			<li>'Bouncing' spells can't be reflected if you're not the primary target, but Counterspell will still allow you to ignore
				a few of them once they bounce to you. Notable examples include Bounty Hunter's Shuriken Toss, Medusa's Mystic Snake,
				and Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask.</li>
			<li>Some AoE spells can be reflected by Counterspell if you are in the AoE. Notable examples include Alchemist's
				Unstable Concoction, Lion's Earth Spike, and Sand King's Burrowstrike.</li>
			<li>If you attack a target that's Bane Nightmare'd with Counterspell on, you'll take it off the target and Bane will
				get Nightmare'd instead of you. Pretty funny.</li>
			<li>If an ally places Linken's on you, activating Counterspell will reflect everything until it times out
				and Linken's will only proc if Counterspell's shield isn't up.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The bonus damage from the passive Quell of Quelling Blade stacks with Battle Fury. Now that I mention it,
				the active also stacks and doesn't share a cooldown with Battle Fury allowing you to cut <i>double the trees!</i>
			</li>
			<li>An excellent hero to practice learning Tread switching on. Get in the rhythm of always tapping your Treads to INT
				before Blinking and then immediately turning them back to AGI. You'd be surprised at how much mana you save.</li>
			<li>The "Blink Uncontrollable Illusion" talent will create an illusion that will aggro the nearest available enemy target.
				When pushing a tower, consider blinking in place to create a bonus illusion that'll help tank and attack a tower.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shadow Demon is a notable counter against AM since the illusions created by Disruption will mana burn
				him.</li>
			<li>Try not to stack disables when ganking AM. Stuns and silences are invaluable when you're trying to kill
				him, but you need to stagger them appropriately otherwise he'll blink out.</li>
			<li>The best players will not only stagger disables, but wait for the middle of AM's 0.4s cast animation on Blink to disable him.
				Spells with multiple stun instances like Cold Snap or Battery Assault can make that timing a bit easier.</li>
			<li>Try baiting Counterspell by canceling cast animations of single targeted spells. The duration isn't that long and Anti-Mages
				may be too trigger happy with activating the shield.</li>
			<li>The Counterspell magic resistance passive can be broken by Silver Edge and other sources of Break.</li>
			<li>Counterspell's active can be dispelled, but not by a Nullifier since Counterspell will just reflect the Nullifier projectile.</li>
			<li>A Ghost Scepter can save your life in the late game as a support.</li>
			<li>Building Kaya reduces the amount of mana you'll lose from Mana Break.</li>
