		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can cast Sprint while TPing and it won't break the channel.</li>
			<li>Avoid Sprinting during fights. You usually want to use Sprint either <i>to get to</i> a fight or when
				you're chasing someone down. 15% bonus damage isn't that dramatic, but every little bit counts.</li>
			<li>Slithereen Crush and Bash procs deal physical damage, making them work very well with Amplify Damage's
				armor reduction.</li>
			<li>Cancel Crush's animation. You can usually tell when you're not going to land it.</li>
			<li>Amplify Damage can be cast on siege creeps to help quickly bring them down during a push.</li>
			<li>Amplify Damage lets your team take Rosh extremely early in the game. Just make sure someone else on your
				team has a targeted spell to take off Rosh's Linken's first.</li>
			<li>People seem to think Slardar's main purpose in the game is: "Oh no, the enemy randomed Riki. I KNOW,
				I'LL COUNTER PICK HIM WITH SLARDAR." The True Sight on Amplify Damage is just the icing on this amazing
				skill's cake. Slardar's main role is to be an initiator who can start fights, wedgie the enemy carry,
				stuff their supports in a locker, then steal Rosh's lunch money.</li>
			<li>However, if you are picking him for countering invis heroes get a gem. Amplify Damage isn't some sort of
				get-out-of-buying-detection-free card. The way to counter invis heroes is to know where they are before
				they know you know where they are.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Juke left or right if Slardar is chasing you and trying to Crush your Slithereen. The AoE on the stun is
				tiny and the cast animation is lengthy.</li>
			<li>Amplify Damage allows the enemy team to take Roshan super early. Keep the pit warded up tight.</li>
			<li>Like with Dust or Track, Amplify Damage can be purged off by Diffusal Blade, Manta Style, or Slark's
				Dark Pact.</li>
		</ul>
