		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>In most situations, the block on Fissure is more valuable than the stun itself. So if you're trying to
				throw out a Fissure from long range, lead it ahead more than you want to. If you don't land the stun,
				it's a minor inconvenience. Separating your team from your target, that's a major inconvenience.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to milk your stun time for as long as possible, don’t mash all your spells at once. You
				can squeeze in about one auto-attack's worth of time in between casts once Aftershock is maxed.
				Alternatively, you can shift+queue your Fissure and Enchant Totem. This'll make Earthshaker wait for his
				full 0.5s backswing animation before casting the next spell.</li>
			<li>If you feel a fight coming on, prime up an Enchant Totem if you have the mana to spare. The duration is
				14 seconds long, so you should be able to walk in with one Enchanted Totem and pull out another one
				during the fight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>ES has basically no mana early game, so you'll often see him sucking down clarities pretty frequently in
				lane. More often than not it can be worth using a spell or tanking some creeps to take it off of him.</li>
			<li>"Hey guys don’t clump, I think ES has blin... Yeah... he does."</li>
