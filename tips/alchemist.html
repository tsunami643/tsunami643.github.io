		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to catch people in Acid Spray before you stun them. Spray lowers armor significantly and Unstable
				Concoction deals physical damage.</li>
			<li>If you're teleporting into a fight, try casting Unstable Concoction before you start the TP. That way
				you'll have a pre-cooked stun ready the moment you show up.</li>
			<li>You can use Unstable Concoction's self-detonate damage to deny yourself.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction will affect the entire AoE, even when it detonates on you. You could theoretically self-detonate
				a Concoction near an enemy to outsmart their Linken's Sphere. If you're spell immune you won't even take
				the self-stun.</li>
			<li>Be aware that enemies can see the Concoction countdown timer.</li>
			<li>You can no longer dodge the self-stun on a failed Concoction by activating Chemical Rage
				at the moment of detonation. Stop trying.</li>
			<li>Alchemist gets the bounty rune multiplier off Greevil's Greed regardless of whichever teammate picks up the rune.</li>
			<li>You get a lot of time between stacks on Greevil's Greed. If you're freefarming, you should be hitting the
				max cap constantly. If you're jungling, learn how to strategically draw aggro from neutral creeps using
				Acid Spray to keep stacks up.</li>
			<li>You can Greevil's Greed off Undying Tombstone zombies. You cannot Greevil's Greed off any illusion, building,
				or ward.</li>
			<li>Activating Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles on cast. You don't need to time it, just activate Rage whenever
				you see a projectile flying towards you.</li>
			<li>Casting Chemical Rage applies a <a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">basic dispel</a>
				on your hero. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or roots.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Just because you think the damage from Acid Spray isn't hurting you that much doesn't mean you should stand
				around in it. Acid Spray drops your armor substantially, so you're far more vulnerable to a gank when in the Spray.</li>
			<li>Alchemist himself has pretty garbage armor, so armor-debuffing spells and items are great for killing
				him through Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction detonates in a small AoE. Don't give your teammate a hug if they're about to get hit
				by the Concoction because it'll stun both of you. Similarly, if you have Alchemist disabled, beware of
				it self-detonating on himself. You'll get stunned if you're too close.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction's projectile cannot be disjointed.</li>
			<li>You can click on Alchemist to see how much time is left on the Chemical Rage buff. Try to time your
				ganks when the buff is about to run out.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition is a good Alc counter since Ice Blast cancels the massive HP regen bonus he gets from
				Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel can significantly reduce the HP regen he gets from Chemical Rage.</li>
