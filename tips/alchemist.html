		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to catch people in Acid Spray <i>before</i> you stun them. Spray lowers armor significantly and Unstable
				Concoction deals physical damage.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction will affect the entire AoE, even when it detonates on you. If you're debuff immune, you won't even take
				the self-stun.</li>
			<li>You can't target creeps with Unstable Concoction, but you can use the self-detonate AoE damage to farm stacked camps
				slightly faster, especially if you lay an Acid Spray down first.</li>
			<li>You can use Unstable Concoction's self-detonate damage to deny yourself.</li>
			<li>Be aware that enemies can see the Concoction countdown timer.</li>
			<li>If you're teleporting into a fight, consider casting Unstable Concoction before you start the TP. That way
				you'll have a pre-cooked stun ready the moment you show up. Only do this if you're the first person to TP to a building, though,
				otherwise you may end up stunning yourself before a delayed TP channel completes.</li>
			<li>You get a lot of time between stacks on Greevil's Greed. If you're freefarming, you should be hitting the
				max cap constantly. If you're jungling, learn how to strategically draw aggro from neutral creeps using
				Acid Spray or any items you have to keep stacks up.</li>
			<li>You can Greevil's Greed off Undying Tombstone zombies, Wraith King skeletons (both lives!), and any type of ward unit.
				You don't get Greevil's Greed from illusions or buildings.</li>
			<li>Activating Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles on cast. You don't need to time it, just activate the spell whenever
				you see a projectile flying towards you.</li>
			<li>Casting Chemical Rage applies a basic dispel on your hero. Use it to wipe off things like DoTs, slows, blinds, or roots.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Gifting an Agh's Scepter also gives an ally all the stats that come with an Agh's Scepter and raises
				their net worth.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If you gift an Agh's Scepter to an ally that already has one, it will be immediately removed from their inventory
				and they will get all their gold back.
				<ul><li><span class="scepter"></span>If you gift an Agh's Scepter to an ally that has an Agh's Blessing, it will also fully refund the price of an Agh's Blessing.
					This includes making gold out of a Roshan Agh's Blessing.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Just because you think the damage from Acid Spray isn't hurting you that much doesn't mean you should stand
				around in it. Acid Spray drops your armor substantially, so you're far more vulnerable to physical damage when in the Spray.</li>
			<li>Alchemist himself has pretty garbage armor, so armor-debuffing spells and items are great for killing
				him through Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction explodes in a small AoE. Don't give your teammate a hug if they're about to get hit
				by the Concoction because it'll stun both of you.
				<ul><li>Similarly, if you have Alchemist disabled mid-Concoction, stay away from the self-detonation. You'll also get stunned if
					you're standing too close to him.</li></ul>
			<li>If you silence Alchemist during Unstable Concoction, he won't be able to throw it until the silence ends.</li>
			<li>Unstable Concoction's projectile cannot be disjointed.</li>
			<li>You can click on Alchemist to see how much time is left on the Chemical Rage buff. Try to time your
				ganks when the buff is about to run out.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing, such as from Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel, Skadi, and Shiva's can reduce the HP regen he gets from Chemical Rage. Be aware that Chemical Rage dispels on cast,
				so only use a Vessel charge on him <i>after</i> he activates Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>You should always care about getting bounty runes, but you should <i>really</i> care about bounty runes if
				you're playing against an Alchemist. He gets a ton of gold from each rune thanks to Greevil's Greed.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>The Agh's Shard Berserk Potion buff can be purged off enemies.</li>
