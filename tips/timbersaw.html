		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Timbersaw's Exposure Therapy innate gives him mana for every tree he kills.</li>
			<li>Whirling Death can be activated while you're mid-Timber Chain.</li>
			<li>Be generous when targeting Timber Chain. It's okay to sacrifice ~50 range to ensure you aren't
				whiffing Chains.</li>
			<li>Timber Chain gives a very small slice of vision as it travels and gives 400 ground vision for a split second once it reaches
				max distance. You can use this to quickly scout inside the Rosh pit if you don't want to spend Chakram for vision.</li>
			<li>If you Eul's yourself after casting Timber Chain, you'll fly up and the cyclone will get canceled once
				the Chain hits a tree. Use this to dodge enemies who may try to cancel your Chain cast with stuns.</li>
			<li>Using Blink Dagger immediately after casting Timber Chain allows you to change your angle of approach
				to a targeted tree. You can use this to get Chain damage on an enemy and still quickly return
				to safety. You can also toss a Chain, blink into a creep wave and Whirling Death, and promptly fly out.</li>
			<li>If you and your lane partner have amazing communication, you may be able to catch enemies off guard by having an ally
				plant an Iron Branch right on top of an enemy to give you a surprise Timber Chain target.</li>
			<li>You can cast Chakram before Timber Chain connects or during the travel time to cut down on the Chakram cast animation.
				Timber will start the animation for Chakram as soon as he's in range of wherever you targeted it. Shift+queueing Chakram after casting Chain
				is the guaranteed fastest way to do this.</li>
			<li>Remember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy
				hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro to help build Reactive Armor stacks.
				<ul><li>You can even use the top bar portraits to draw aggro. If you see an enemy hero is in vision on your minimap,
					you can attack+move (default A+left click) the enemy top bar portrait and it'll issue an attack command which'll
					draw creep aggro without having to move your camera.</li></ul>
			<li>Go into the jungle and tank a few neutrals to build up Reactive Armor stacks before a gank/dive.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>The Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor active can be dispelled by enemies, but you'll
				deal the explosion damage when the buff is removed.</li>
			<li>An enemy can receive the burst damage from the Chakram once when it flies out and once when it's coming
				back. So if it looks like an enemy is about to escape the AoE of the Chakram, just return it while
				they're still in it. The extra passthrough damage will be more useful than a few more milliseconds of
				slow.</li>
			<li>The lower an enemy's HP, the greater the Chakram slow will be.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw is disarmed when a Chakram is out.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to prevent someone from Blinking out when they're exiting a banish or Eul's or respawning from Aegis,
				don't expect a stationary Chakram to reliably cancel their Dagger. A Chakram in place only deals damage during set intervals. However, a <i>moving</i>
				Chakram checks for units to damage every tick that it's traveling. So time your Chakram cast/return so that it's moving
				underneath the enemy when they appear.</li>
			<li>Learn the trees on the map. There are many unique juke paths that only Timber can take advantage of
				thanks to his skill set.</li>
			<li>When escaping late game, try carving out paths with Chakram before Timber Chaining. Timber Chaining into
				a deforested area could buy you a few seconds of fog.</li>
			<li><span class="facet"></span>The "Twisted Chakram" facet always travels to Timbersaw's left first as it goes through its infinity âˆž path.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Flamethrower can damage buildings.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Flamethrower sets trees on fire as well. They will be destroyed after
				burning for 5 seconds.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't stand next to trees when laning against or escaping from a Timbersaw. The distance you're saving by
				hugging the treeline won't matter when he purely damages your ass.</li>
			<li>In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. You'll give Timbersaw fewer angles
				to Chain off of or fewer trees to get Whirling Death damage off of.</li>
			<li>The "Light Collector" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you which can help counter Timber Chain or Whirling Death.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw hates being silenced, especially if he has a Chakram out because that means he literally can't
				do anything. He can't attack because Chakram disarms him, and he can't return the Chakram because he's silenced.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw cannot Timber Chain when rooted or leashed.
				<ul><li>Or more accurately, he can't <i>cast</i> Timber Chain. If he's already shot his Chain projectile, it'll still pull him even if he's rooted.</li></ul>
			<li>If you stun Timbersaw at any point after the Chain projectile comes out, he'll stop moving. If your team has a shortage of stuns, save them
				for when you see his Chain come out as opposed to preventing him from casting the spell at all. That way his Chain goes on cooldown, but he won't go anywhere.</li>
			<li>If you have an Iron Branch in lane and wanna go for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYbwFeochIc">big plays</a>, you can try
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptUUdydjueo">planting a tree</a> right in front of Timber when
				he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzhlVc9Vgfo">trying to escape</a> and intercept his Timber Chain cast. Other players besides
				Arteezy probably do this, but no one cares when they do it.</li>
			<li><a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Break">Breaking</a> Timbersaw will stop him from gaining new Reactive Armor stacks, but existing stacks will remain.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel can help mitigate the HP regen Timber gains from Reactive Armor. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing like from Reactive Armor.</li>
			<li>Chakram has a fairly slow travel time, so it's usually worth sacrificing some positioning if it means
				you can sidestep the saw when he's chasing you.</li>
			<li>Be mindful when right click harassing him in lane. Often times, Timber's prefer the Reactive stacks.
				Ideally you want to harass him with magic damage exclusively, if possible.</li>
			<li>If you're a strength hero, Whirling Death's primary attribute loss debuff will make you extremely vulnerable
				in lane.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can remove the Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor barrier with basic dispels,
				but Timbersaw will explode the moment it's dispelled.</li>
