		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Doppelganger allows you to travel up and down cliffs.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger breaks trees upon landing. Use this to find juking enemies or to create quicker jungle
				routes.</li>
			<li>Much like every other illusion hero out there, you can sometimes be tricky by microing an illusion out
				of the pack to bait enemies into thinking it's the real you.</li>
			<li>The brighter of the two illusions from Doppelganger is the one that takes 100% damage. You can assign this
				one to a control group and it will stick each time Doppelganger is used.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger can dispel all the debuffs that a Manta Style would... except for roots and silences because you
				literally can't cast the spell when rooted or silenced.</li>
			<li>Casting Doppelganger adds 2 seconds duration to any gathered illusions.</li>
			<li>Treat Doppelganger's banish like Puck's Phase Shift when playing against a team with a lot of projectile
				spells.</li>
			<li>If you get jumped by an enemy and need to banish yourself quickly, cast Doppelganger in the same direction
				your hero is facing rather than turning around. PL's turn rate is average, but every millisecond can count when escaping.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger forces your hero's location to the target area once the banish ends. This allows you to outplay spells like Disruptor's Glimpse
				or Kunkka's X Marks the Spot which typically take repositioning priority.</li>
			<li>When Roshing, you can click on Rosh to see the cooldown on his Slam. Rosh will always cast it once his attack animation ends
				and it's off cooldown. Doppelganger during the cast animation to avoid you and your illusions taking a bunch of unnecessary damage.</li>
			<li>You can get cute with denies by Phantom Rushing to an enemy creep, canceling the Rush, then hitting your creep while the
				AGI buff is on.</li>
			<li>Phantom Rush can be toggled on or off. This is useful in the laning phase if you only want it to trigger when
				last hitting specific creeps.</li>
			<li>If you see a unit across a cliff, but you're in Phantom Rush range, PL will sprint to it taking the
				quickest pathing possible.
				<ul><li>When farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Phantom Rush onto to quickly
					go up cliffs or behind trees without using Doppelganger.</li></ul>
			<li>Phantom Rush is always toggled on for Juxtapose illusions and will always be off cooldown when they spawn.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to utilize Phantom Rush when escaping. Sprint to a neutral or enemy lane creep to get the
				speed boost. Phantom Rush will even work on enemy buildings and ward units.</li>
			<li>Phantom Rush speed overrides any slowing debuffs that your hero or illusions are under.</li>
			<li>When tower diving, A+left click (or your attack/deny command hotkey) your illusions during attack
				backswings to attempt to shake tower aggro momentarily.
				<ul><li>Use A+left click (default) when taking jungle camps or Rosh to relieve yourself of creep aggro once you generate some
					illusions.</li></ul>
			<li>You can use the "next unit" hotkey in your settings to rapid fire cycle through your illusions and send them in a bunch of
				different directions to cause chaos when you're escaping an enemy.</li>
			<li>Juxtapose doesn't multiply on buildings, but does on wards. This makes PL very effective against things like
				Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, Pugna's Nether Ward, Undying's Tombstone, Venomancer's Plague Wards, and Zeus's Nimbus.
				Illusions don't deal damage to Phoenix's Supernova, but you can Juxtapose off hitting it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to bait out Doppelganger by animation canceling spells.</li>
			<li>If you think you've finally found the real PL and started targeting a spell on him, resist the urge to keep mashing the hotkey.
				You may inadvertently cancel the cast and lose him again in the Sea of Lancers.</li>
			<li>Some debuffs that can help identify the real PL that can't be dispelled by Doppelganger: Bloodseeker's Rupture,
				Huskar's Burning Spears, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Shadow Demon's Shadow Poison, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike,
				Windranger's Focus Fire, and Nullifier's active.
			<ul><li>Monkey King's Jingu Mastery counter can't be dispelled and the counter doesn't apply on illusions. So if you Boundless Strike
				his army, you'll immediately be able to find the real PL.</li>
				<li>Other heroes with spells that are particularly useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or
				Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.</li></ul>
			<li>Another useful method to identifying the real PL is to quickly check his Magic Wand charges. PL illusions will
				duplicate the number of charges the real hero has when they're created, but won't get new charges unlike the real PL. This
				is mainly useful when he's escaping with Doppelganger and trying to juke you with his tanky illusion.</li>
			<li>Rubick can't Spell Steal from illusions. You can mash Spell Steal on PL's army to vaguely identify the real one since all the fake
				illusions will give Spell Steal an error. The error works even when Spell Steal is out of range, so you can globally identify the real PL
				with this.</li>
			<li>While Morphling can't copy PL's Juxtapose as a Morph, Spirit Lance/Doppelganger illusions created by a Morphed PL <i>can</i> Juxtapose,
				allowing you to create your own PL army by proxy.</li>
			<li>Phantom Lancer can't cast Doppelganger while rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Radiance's Burn, Shiva's Guard's Arctic Blast, and Maelstrom, Mjollnir, and Gleipnir's Chain Lightning all deal bonus damage to illusions.
			<ul><li>Mjollnir's Static Shield active has a chance to proc off of every PL illusion whacking you.</li></ul>
			<li>Crimson Guard's active basically neutralizes all illusion damage, though you'll still take the mana burn
				from Diffusal.</li>
			<li>Debuff immunity/BKB prevents mana burn from Diffusal Blade.</li>
			<li>Phantom Lancer, his illusions, and Diffusal Blade all deal physical damage, so build armor.</li>
