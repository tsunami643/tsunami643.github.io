		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Doppelganger allows you to travel up and down cliffs.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger breaks trees upon landing. Use this to find juking enemies or to create quicker jungle
				routes.</li>
			<li>Treat Doppelganger like Puck's Phase Shift when playing against a team with a lot of projectile
				spells.</li>
			<li>Much like every other illusion hero out there, you can sometimes be tricky by microing an illusion out
				of the pack to bait enemies into thinking it's the real you.</li>
			<li>The brighter of the two illusions from Doppelganger is the one that takes 100% damage. You can assign this
				one to a control group and it will stick each time Doppelganger is used.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger can purge/dispel all the debuffs that a Manta Style would. Besides silences, obviously.</li>
			<li>Casting Doppelganger adds 2 seconds duration to all your illusions.</li>
			<li>If you get jumped by an enemy and need to banish yourself quickly, cast Doppelganger in the same direction
				your hero is facing rather than turning around. PL's turn rate is average, but every millisecond can count when escaping.</li>
			<li>Doppelganger forces your hero's location to the target area once the banish ends. This allows you to outplay spells like Glimpse
				or X Marks the Spot which typically take repositioning priority.</li>
			<li>When Roshing, you can click on Rosh to see the cooldown on his Slam. Doppelganger during the cast animation
				to avoid you and your illusions taking a bunch of unnecessary damage.</li>
			<li>You only get the bonus AGI from Phantom Rush once the Rush ends or is canceled. The AGI buff lasts for 2
				seconds afterwards.</li>
			<li>You can get cute with denies by Rushing to an enemy creep, canceling the Rush, then hitting your creep with the
				AGI buff.</li>
			<li>Phantom Rush can be toggled on or off. This is useful in the laning phase if you only want it to trigger when
				last hitting specific creeps.</li>
			<li>When farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Phantom Rush onto to quickly
				go up cliffs or behind trees without using Juxtapose.</li>
			<li>Phantom Rush is always toggled on for Juxtapose illusions and will always be off cooldown when they spawn.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to utilize Phantom Rush when escaping. Sprint to a neutral or enemy lane creep to get the
				speed boost. Phantom Rush will even work on enemy buildings and ward units.</li>
			<li>If you see a unit across a cliff, but you're in Phantom Rush range, PL will sprint to it taking the
				quickest pathing possible.</li>
			<li>Phantom Rush speed overrides any slowing debuffs that your hero or illusions are under.</li>
			<li>When tower diving, A+left click (or your attack/deny command hotkey) your illusions during attack
				backswings to attempt to shake tower aggro momentarily.</li>
			<li>Also use A+left click (default) when taking jungle camps or Rosh to relieve yourself of creep aggro once you generate some
				illusions.</li>
			<li>You can use the "next unit" hotkey in your settings to rapid fire cycle through your illusions and send them in a bunch of
				different directions to cause chaos when you're escaping an enemy.</li>
			<li>Juxtapose doesn't multiply on buildings, but does on wards. This makes PL very effective against things like
				Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, Pugna's Nether Ward, Undying's Tombstone, Veno's Plague Wards, and Zeus's Nimbus.
				Illusions don't deal damage to Phoenix's Supernova, but you can Juxtapose off hitting it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to bait out Doppelganger by animation canceling spells.</li>
			<li>Resist the urge to spam click targeted spells on Phantom Lancer. Once you think you've selected the real one, leave it alone.
				You may lose him in the Sea of Lancers if you keep spamming your spell before it goes off.</li>
			<li>Some debuffs that can help identify the real PL and won't be purged off by Doppel: Windranger's Focus Fire,
				Ursa's Fury Swipes, Huskar's Burning Spears, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Monkey King's Jingu Mastery counter,
				Viper's Viper Strike, Shadow Demon's Shadow Poison, and Bloodseeker's Rupture.</li>
			<li>Other heroes with spells that are useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or
				Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.</li>
			<li>Another useful method to identifying the real PL is to quickly check his Magic Wand charges. PL illusions will
				duplicate the number of charges the real hero has when they're created, but won't get new charges unlike the real PL. This
				is mainly useful when he's escaping with Doppelganger and trying to juke you with his tanky illusion.</li>
			<li>While Morphling can't copy PL's Juxtapose as a Morph, Spirit Lance/Doppelganger illusions created by a Morphed PL <i>can</i> Juxtapose,
				allowing you to create your own PL army by proxy.</li>
			<li>Phantom Lancer can't cast Doppelganger while rooted/leashed.</li>
			<li>Radiance's Burn, Shiva's Guard's Arctic Blast, and Maelstrom, Mjollnir, and Gleipnir's Chain Lightning all deal bonus damage to illusions.
			<ul><li>Mjollnir's Static Shield active has a chance to proc off of every PL illusion whacking you.</li></ul>
			<li>Crimson Guard's active basically neutralizes all illusion damage, though you'll still take the mana burn
				from Diffusal.</li>
			<li>Debuff immunity prevents mana burn from Diffusal Blade.</li>
			<li>Phantom Lancer, his illusions, and Diffusal Blade all deal physical damage, so build armor.</li>
		</ul>
