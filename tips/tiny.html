		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Avalanche is constantly stunning in the AoE. So throw it in advance if you know a hero will be in the AoE before
				it finishes (mid-banish, pre-TP).</li>
			<li>Avalanche deals bonus damage to enemies that are Tossed.</li>
			<li>The Ava-toss combo works best if you use Toss slightly after Avalanche connects.</li>
			<li>While it can be tempting to always combo Avalanche into Toss, remember that Toss itself counts as a brief stun.
				Against enemies with escapes you may be better off staggering the Toss after Avalanche's stun ends to squeeze
				in more right clicks or to buy more time for allies to arrive.</li>
			<li>Toss damages buildings if a unit lands near it.</li>
			<li>Tossing enemy or allied heroes will break their channels.</li>
			<li>Toss always grabs the unit closest to Tiny.</li>
			<li>You can Toss people to runes.</li>
			<li>When you're getting ganked by melee enemies, always be looking for units to Toss your aggressors away to.</li>
			<li>Attacking a building with a Tree can splash damage onto creeps, but attacking creeps will not splash damage onto buildings.</li>
			<li>When ground targeting a Tree Throw, the tree will disintegrate and damage the first enemy unit it collides into, ignoring structures.
				A Thrown Tree will not 'cleave,' but instead explode in a circular AoE around the target.</li>
			<li>Throwing a Tree provides vision as it travels.</li>
			<li>A Thrown Tree is similar to Phantom Assassin's Stifling Dagger in that it basically acts like an attack once it lands. You can proc
				on-hit effects like bash or go invis in Shadow Blade/Silver Edge while the Tree is flying and it'll land with the
				Shadow Walk bonus damage.</li>
			<li>Since a Thrown Tree counts as a right click, it'll break your Smoke when it lands on a unit. Make sure your Thrown Tree doesn't
				connect on anything if you're trying to get a fresh Tree mid-Smoke.</li>
			<li>You can't directly target couriers with Tree Throw, but a skillshotted Tree or a Throw that explodes near a courier can damage
				the donkey.</li>
			<li>Denial attacks with a Tree will consume charges but <i>won't</i> cleave onto enemies.</li>
			<li>Let your right clicks finish. Tiny's attack speed is constantly changing throughout the course of the
				game, which makes it a real pain to consistently cancel his backswing animation. Err on the side of
				caution and be patient. </li>
			<li>You can "store" the max attack speed second hit of an Echo Sabre by cancelling the attack before it connects.
				The attack speed buff lasts indefinitely, so you can spend the first right click on a creep and then store
				the fast attack for another target.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Echo Sabre will apply the slow with every Agh's Scepter Tree Volley attack and not go on cooldown.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>As long as the rocks are flying around, an Avalanche will stun you if you walk into the AoE.</li>
			<li>Beware of being Tossed backwards into Tiny's tower during the laning phase. If Tiny starts running towards you for no good reason, watch out.</li>
			<li>Tiny has no armor to start. Coupled with his super slow attack animation, Tiny can't trade hits very
				well in lane.</li>
			<li>Breaks don't disable any aspect of Tiny's Grow. Would be pretty funny if it did, though.</li>
			<li>Tiny is all about burst comboing enemies down. A Fluffy Hat or two could save your life early on if you're a support.</li>
