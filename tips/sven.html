		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The "Storm Hammer Dispels Enemies" talent works to purge off Ghost Scepter and spells like Guardian Angel and whatnot.</li>
			<li>Linken's Sphere can severely cut Sven's solo ganking potential, but remember that Storm Hammer stuns and
				damages everything in its AoE. If an enemy has Linken's but is sitting inside their creep wave, just target
				the Hammer on a creep.</li>
			<li>Warcry works fully on illusions and creep-heroes (Visage Familiars, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, or Warlock's Golem),
				making them far more tanky against right click damage.</li>
			<li>Mechanically, think of Warcry like a Pipe for right clicks/attack damage. It isn't 'damage block' like a Crimson Guard,
				it's damage negation.</li>
			<li>Damage absorbed from Warcry prevents on-damage effects from triggering, like Blink Dagger's damage cooldown or consumables
				being dispelled.</li>
			<li>Attacks from ward-type units (Death Ward, Serpent Wards, Plague Wards) will be negated by Warcry.</li>
			<li>Since Warcry scales with Sven's STR on cast, you should try activating God's Strength <i>before</i> casting Warcry.</li>
			<li>God's Strength multiplies Sven's primary attribute damage. Meaning, when you go full WOLOLO, your STR is
				getting multiplied, but items that are adding green + damage (raw damage items) aren't get multiplied.</li>
			<li>God's Strength raises your HP when cast thanks to the STR addition, so you may consider using it when escaping
				if the bonus HP will help you survive a gank.</li>
			<li>Core Sven is a rare hero on whom BKB is truly <i>core</i> core. On nearly every other hero, BKB is
				primarily bought as a defensive item, but because God's Strength jacks Sven up from his STR, BKB is also a
				strong offensive item. This is the same reason why Heart can actually be a viable damage item on Sven.</li>
			<li>BKB is also necessary to serve as the can opener for the whoop ass you deliver with God's Strength. Time
				spent disabled is time spent not smashing everything in your path.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Storm Hammer's projectile can be disjointed. However, <i><a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sven/Changelogs">despite
				the 6.79 changelog never explicitly being reverted,</a></i> the AoE stun will still land even after the Hammer is disjointed.
				Spagooti code.</li>
			<li>Warcry can be purged off Sven and his allies.</li>
