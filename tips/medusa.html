		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Mystic Snake bounces are <i>not random.</i> The Snake will always take the shortest possible bounce
				once it reaches a target. This means that a Mystic Snake targeted on a melee creep will almost always
				bounce between other melee creeps before jumping to the ranged creep because they're always so tightly packed.
				It also means that if a hero is hanging around near their ranged creep, the Snake will almost definitely bounce to
				them before going to the rest of the creep wave.</li>
			<li>The way the damage scales on Mystic Snake is opposite of Fade Bolt. You're gaining damage for each
				target hit, not losing it. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get
				the max damage.</li>
			<li>"Damn, I really wished I had Mana Shield turned off before that gank," said no Medusa ever. At a certain
				point in the game (read: after the laning phase) there are very few reasons to ever have Mana Shield
				turned off. Only if you're unsure if you'll have mana to use Stone Gaze should you have it off.</li>
			<li>Toggling Mana Shield can prevent Rubick from stealing your better spells.</li>
			<li>BKB blocks the mana burn from Diffusal Blade.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>When a Mystic Snake gets tossed out on the lane ask yourself, "Would Fade Bolt be able to jump to me
				from here?" If you said yes, then you probably already got hit by it.</li>
			<li>Your all-purpose mana burners are good against Dusa. Invoker (EMP), Nyx (Mana Burn),
				Outworld Devourer (Arcane Orb and Sanity's Eclipse), Lion (Mana Drain), Clockwerk (Cog burn),
				Anti-Mage (Mana Break) are obvious counterpicks.</li>
			<li>Heroes who easily build Diffusal Blade or Necronomicon are also good for burning her mana.</li>
			<li>Brewmaster's Cinder Brew is highly effective against Medusa since each of her Split Shots roll
				for a chance to self-attack.</li>
			<li>Stone Gaze will petrify you after you look at her for two cumulative seconds. Turning away from her doesn't reset the timer;
				it'll continue counting down from where the timer left off when you start looking at her again.</li>
			<li>Windranger can attack Medusa during Stone Gaze while walking away with Focus Fire.</li>
			<li>You can't dispel the two second Gaze timer, but you can dodge the petrification with banishes. You still count as
				facing Medusa even if you're in a banish, so if you time it properly, the stun will trigger while you're in your banish.
				When you exit the banish, you won't be stunned and a new two second timer will begin.
			</li>
			<li>Activating Phase Boots on melee heroes can improve your turn rate when dealing with Stone Gaze.</li>
