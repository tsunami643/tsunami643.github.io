		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Split Shot hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit a tower if you're attacking creeps.</li>
			<li>If you're hitting a single target and Split Shot is toggled on, you're still taking the damage reduction.
				Stop attacking Rosh, finishing jungle camps, or pushing creepless towers with Split Shot on.</li>
			<li>Illusions will either have Split Shot on or off depending on how you had it toggled before they spawned.</li>
			<li>Mystic Snake bounces are <i>not random.</i> The Snake will always take the shortest possible bounce
				once it reaches a target. This means that a Mystic Snake targeted on a melee creep will almost always
				bounce between other melee creeps before jumping to the ranged creep because they're always so tightly packed.
				It also means that if a hero is hanging around near their ranged creep, the Snake will almost definitely bounce to
				them before going to the rest of the creep wave.</li>
			<li>Mystic Snake gains damage for each subsequent target it hits. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get
				the max damage.</li>
			<li>A general rule of thumb for determining if a jungle creep has a mana pool: If they have an active spell, they have mana.
				You can always left click on them to find out for sure. Camps where <i>all</i> the creeps have mana, like Satyr or Mud Golem camps,
				are great sources to refill yourself.</li>
			<li>Mana Shield absorbs damage <i>before</i> any damage manipulation is calculated. This means that things like having more minus armor or other
				damage amps on your hero won't increase the amount of mana lost by Mana Shield.</li>
			<li>"Damn, I really wished I had Mana Shield turned off before that gank," said no Medusa ever. At a certain
				point in the game (read: after the laning phase or when you're jungling safely) there are very few reasons
				to ever have Mana Shield turned off. Only if you're unsure if you'll have mana to use Stone Gaze should you have it off.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Mana Shield while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>When playing against a Rubick, be sure to toggle Mana Shield or Split Shot after casting Mystic Snake to give him a worse spell to steal.</li>
			<li>BKB blocks the mana burn from Diffusal Blade.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span><span class="shard"></span>If you have Agh's Scepter, the Snake shot out from Agh's Shard Cold Blooded will
				also stone the target.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Your all-purpose mana burners can be good against Dusa early/mid game. Invoker (EMP), Nyx (Mana Burn), Lion (Mana Drain),
				Silencer (Glaives of Wisdom), Anti-Mage (Mana Break) are obvious counterpicks. Heroes who easily build Diffusal
				Blade can also be useful for burning her mana.</li>
			<li>Stone Gaze will petrify you after you look at her for two cumulative seconds. Turning away from her doesn't reset the timer;
				it'll continue counting down from where the timer left off when you start looking at her again.</li>
			<li>Windranger can attack Medusa during Stone Gaze while walking away with Focus Fire.</li>
			<li>You can't dispel the two second Gaze timer, but you can dodge the petrification with banishes. You still count as
				facing Medusa even if you're in a banish (including Eul's Cyclone), so if you time it properly, the stun will
				trigger while you're in your banish. When you exit the banish, you won't be stunned and a new two second timer will begin.
			</li>
			<li>Activating Phase Boots on melee heroes can improve your turn rate when dealing with Stone Gaze.</li>
			<li>Mars's Bulwark active can redirect Split Shot attacks to Mars.</li>
			<li>Medusa is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on her.</li>
			<li>Breaks can disable Split Shot.</li>
