        <div class="tips">
            <h1>Tips</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Spear of Mars provides 300 flying vision as it travels and the vision lingers around an impaled enemy.</li>
                <li>The Spear does not ignore illusions, it'll skewer them just like a normal hero.</li>
                <li>Invisible units can get Speared, but you'll only get true sight on the target if they get impaled on something.</li>
                <li>Forced movement can shift enemies around after they get skewered, but as long as the Spear still connects to a wall/tree,
                    the enemy will still get stunned wherever they are.</li>
                <li>Earthshaker's Fissure, Tusk's Ice Shards, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Nature's Prophet's Sprout, and obviously your own
                    Arena of Blood's walls count as objects that you can pin an enemy to with your Spear to get the stun.</li>
                <li>Iron Branch trees also count, but the collision with the Spear isn't very consistent.</li>
                <li>The sides of Rosh's pit do not count as walls, only the back of his pit counts. However, there are a few trees
                    surrounding his pit, so aim accordingly if you want to go for the skewering stun, or if you just want to send an
                    enemy flying out of the pit.
                </li>
                <li>Only the primary target of the Spear that is skewered gets stunned. The knockback on other enemies in the path
                    of the Spear does not count as a disable.</li>
                <li>If you're extremely quick fingered, you can cast Arena while an enemy is flying from your Spear and pin them to the Arena wall.</li>
                <li>The knockback on God's Rebuke does not count as a disable and will not cancel enemy channels.</li>
                <li>Damage from God's Rebuke can go through spell immunity, but the knockback won't.</li>
                <li>God's Rebuke performs a true strike instant attack on all targets in the AoE. This means each target has a chance to proc/apply
                    attack modifiers, excluding cleave. Just keep in mind that most chance based procs from items have an internal cooldown and can't
                    proc multiple targets simultaneously.</li>
                <li>God's Rebuke can kill enemy couriers.</li>
                <li>Since God's Rebuke includes a 'right click,' it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.</li>
                <li>Bulwark only reduces damage from attacks and <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Attack_damage#Instant_attacks">instant attacks</a>, but not physical damage spells.</li>
                <li>When Bulwark is toggled on, any attack projectile launched within 800 range of Mars, and within the front and side angles of Bulwark,
                    has a percentage chance to travel straight to Mars instead of their original intended targets.
                    This works against projectiles from Medusa's Split Shot or Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon.</li>
                <li>Toggling Bulwark on will also redirect attacks from towers, including the multishots from glyphed towers. Active Bulwark also redirects attacks from ward-type
                    units, like Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards or Witch Doctor's Death Ward.</li>
                <li>Toggling Bulwark can prevent Rubick from stealing your better spells.</li>
                <li>You can toggle Bulwark while channeling a TP.</li>
                <li>When Bulwark is toggled on, you don't have to turn to cast items. This includes items targetable on enemies, like Eul's, Force Staff, Medallion, Urn of Shadows, etc.</li>
                <li>Normally, casting a TP scroll will turn your hero to the direction of the structure you're traveling to. But since you don't have to turn to cast items when
                    Bulwark is on, you can also avoid turning to your TP target. This can be useful if you're escaping and TP'ing to fountain. Face your
                    attackers, toggle Bulwark on, then channel the TP to benefit from Bulwark's damage reduction while TP'ing in the opposite direction.</li>
                <li>Not having to turn for items can be especially useful if you have a Blink and are getting Eul's combo'd and you have
                    a way to mitigate the landing damage of the Cyclone (like Raindrop, Hood, Pipe, Eternal Shroud). While you're cycloned, activate the Hood/Pipe,
                    shift+queue Bulwark's active, then shift+queue your Blink Dagger and you should be able to instantly Blink out without having to turn.</li>
                <li><span class="scepter"></span>The Agh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers attack once per second. The one second interval is calculated only while Bulwark is
                    toggled on. You can somewhat abuse this by toggling Bulwark on during the 'backswing' interval, then toggling off before the soldiers are about to attack.
                    Then the next time you toggle them on, they'll attack immediately, and then reset again for another full second.</li>
                <li><span class="scepter"></span>The Agh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers can proc any attack modifiers your hero has. They also ignore disarms.
                    They can also attack towers.</li>
                <li>Arena of Blood blocks enemy attack projectiles from entering the ring. This includes attacks from towers or the fountain.</li>
                <li>Here are the rules of engagement when dealing with the Arena of Blood:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enemies can freely blink in or out of the Arena.</li>
                        <li>Spell immunity allows enemies to pass freely through the Arena walls.</li>
                        <li>Heroes with flying movement can pass through the Arena walls. This includes Night Stalker in Dark Ascension,
                            Winter Wyvern in Arctic Burn, Clockwerk in Agh's Shard Jetpack, and Visage in Agh's Scepter Silent as the Grave. </li>
                        <li>Anything that affects an enemy's z-axis position (height off the ground) allows them to pass
                            in or out of the Arena. This means spells like Mirana's Leap, Slark's Pounce, Ursa's Earthshock, or Huskar's Life Break
                            allow enemies to go over the Arena walls.</li>
                        <li>This also means if you Spear or Force Staff a flying enemy or even an enemy who's mid-bounce from spells
                            like Earth Spike/Impale or Torrent or Ravage, they will yeet right out of the Arena.</li>
                        <li>Spells that provide free pathing, like Spectre's Spectral Dagger or Centaur's Agh's Scepter Stampede,
                            do <i>not</i> allow enemies to pass through the Arena. Batrider's Firefly doesn't make him a flying unit,
                            it just provides free pathing, so he can't escape the Arena either.</li>
                        <li>Heroes can utilize forced movement spells to shove targets into your Arena, like with
                            Earth Spirit's Boulder Smash or Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, but they can't use those spells to take people out
                            of the Arena.</li>
                        <li>Pudge can Meat Hook enemy heroes in or out of the Arena. When Hooking them out, they'll still bump into the Arena wall,
                            but Meat Hook <i>always</i> brings targets to the Hook location once it ends.</li>
                        <li>Enemy Clockwerks can Hookshot into the Arena, but not Hook themselves out of the Arena. Either direction, he'll still bump into
                            the wall and get the Hook canceled before he reaches his target.</li>
                        <li>The Arena walls will attack invisible units regardless of detection.</li>
                        <li>The wall's knockback is non-disabling, so you can't Force Staff a TP'ing enemy into the wall
                            to cancel their channel.</li>
                        <li>There is an extremely small window of time after a knockback is triggered that an enemy can use some positioning spells
                            to go through the wall while the knockback soldier is resetting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h1>Counters</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I advise scrolling up and reading through the Arena rules to figure out what does and doesn't work to get out of it.
                    Quick reference is heroes that can change their z-axis (Mirana, Slark, Ursa, or flying heroes) can enter or exit the Arena over the walls and
                    spell immunity allows you to walk through the walls (Juggernaut, Lifestealer, building BKB).</li>
                <li>Bulwark can be disabled with Breaks.</li>
                <li>Heroes dealing high magic damage are invaluable since Bulwark only reduces right clicks.</li>
                <li>Magic damage can also penetrate the Arena of Blood, whereas right click projectiles will be blocked by the wall.</li>
                <li>If you have a Quelling Blade/Battle Fury or Tango, you can try to go for big plays by lining yourself up with a tree
                    for him to Spear you against and then eating the tree before the Spear connects.
