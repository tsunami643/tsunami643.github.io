		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere if they're reachable on the edge. You can Boulder Smash
				allies out of leashes like Slark's Pounce or Grimstroke's Soulbind. You can also Smash people out of Disruptor's
				Kinetic Field.</li>
			<li>If an enemy is standing on you trying to block your Rolling Boulder escape, use Boulder Smash
				to boot the enemy away first and then Roll away.</li>
			<li>You can drop a Remnant while you're revving up in Rolling Boulder.</li>
			<li>You can double tap the Remnant hotkey to automatically drop one in front of yourself.</li>
			<li>You can use items while Rolling (except Blink and TP scrolls). This can be useful for Shiva's,
				Scythe of Vyse/Orchid, Eul's, and wards. </li>
			<li>If you use Force Staff mid-Roll movement, you'll get the Force but the Boulder will break apart. If you use a Force Staff while the Boulder
				is revving up, you'll get the Force and continue Rolling starting from your new location. There are multiple applications of this interaction:
				<ul>
					<li>You can Force Staff yourself to potentially phase through an enemy blocking your Boulder path before you start Rolling.</li>
					<li>You can immediately turn your hero left or right after starting the Roll and Force Staff yourself to change your starting trajectory.</li>
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/KuKg-Cecp6w?t=49">Here's a video by Qwerja demonstrating both interactions.</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You can pick up runes while Rolling.</li>
			<li>If you Roll over the edges of the map, you briefly get high ground vision over the surrounding treeline. This can be useful
				to scout out enemies that may be hiding while defending tier 2 towers.</li>
			<li>If you Roll over the edges of the map at an angle, you'll be placed back onto the map without breaking any trees behind you.
				If you're trying to escape enemies chasing you in the trees, consider doing this instead of bulldozing every tree in a straight line.
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDkPRc-dECg">There is an extremely small window of time in which you can Smash a Remnant
				that you're about to Roll into and you'll get the full Roll distance while also sending an invisible Smash projectile.</a>
				Mechanically, think of it like you're consuming the Remnant with your Roll while it's being Smashed away.
			</li>
			<li>You can use/target spells while you're in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while
				you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.</li>
			<li>When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle
				from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately
				kick them back along the path you came.</li>
			<li>Nearly all of your spells destroy trees in some way. Useful against heroes like Nature's Prophet or Monkey King.</li>
			<li>Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels when directly targeted on the hero.</li>
			<li>Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an
				enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.</li>
			<li>The disadvantage of recycling is that you end up stacking your total disables on top of each other.
				If you have Remnants to burn, stagger your spells.</li>
			<li>Remember that you can get the Geomagnetic Grip silence from pulling allied creeps too. You don't have to use Remnants to get
				the silence.</li>
			<li>The search trigger radius on a Remnant from a Magnetized unit is smaller than the activation/refresh radius to
				Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to Magnetized enemies.</li>
			<li>The Magnetize DoT lasts for 6 seconds on an enemy. Space out re-Magnetizations to squeeze out the most
				damage.</li>
			<li>The Magnetize DoT can affect enemies through spell immunity. So if you need damage, cast Magnetize after BKBs are activated
				to make sure it doesn't get dispelled. Only the damage goes through, however, none of the other debuffs pierce spell immunity.</li>
			<li>If any one Magnetized target gets silenced from Grip or slowed by Smash, all other Magnetized targets will
				receive the same debuff.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Rolling into an Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant will immediately take the hero you Stoned
				out of Remnant form.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can cast Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant on yourself as Earth Spirit and then use Boulder
				Smash on yourself.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant can also be used on Stone Remnants if you want the damage.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can't Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant spell immune enemies, but you <i>can</i> cast it on spell
				immune allies.
				<ul><li>You can't Boulder Smash a spell immune Enchant Remnant'd ally (or yourself). It'll put Smash on cooldown
					and nothing will happen.</li>
					<li>You can Geomagnetic Grip a spell immune Enchant Remnant'd ally.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>You can cast Enchant Remnant on allied ward units. This is mostly useless because the ward
				unit dies once Enchant Remnant times out. However, one useful situation is using Enchant Remnant on an allied Phoenix Supernova
				to protect it. If Supernova ends before Enchant Remnant times out, the Egg will stun. If Enchant Remnant times out <i>before</i>
				Supernova ends, the Egg will jankily sink into the ground and not stun anything. In both situations, the Egg will be untargetable
				and Phoenix will respawn as expected.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kaolin Showdown isn't invulnerable inside the Rolling Boulder. He's fully targetable and can be stunned
				and damaged as expected.</li>
			<li>When killing an Earth Spirit, stand in front of his Rolling Boulder and make him hit you to prevent him
				from Rolling out of the situation.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit cannot cast Rolling Boulder when rooted or leashed.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit needs a lot of time to recharge Remnants after a team fight. Keep high aggression when
				playing against an Earth Spirit.</li>
			<li>Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and
				they're not.</li>
			<li>Magnetize can be dispelled.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If Earth Spirit has an Agh's Shard, be aware that his Remnants are giving a small radius
				of vision.</li>
