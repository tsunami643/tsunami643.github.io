		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere if they're reachable on the edge. You can Boulder Smash
				allies out of leashes like Slark's Pounce or Grimstroke's Soulbind.</li>
			<li>If an enemy is standing on you trying to block your Rolling Boulder escape, use Boulder Smash
				to boot the enemy away first and then roll away.</li>
			<li>You can drop a Remnant while you're revving up in Rolling Boulder.</li>
			<li>You can double tap the Remnant hotkey to automatically drop one in front of yourself.</li>
			<li>You can use items while Rolling (except Blink and TP scrolls). This can be useful for Shiva's,
				Scythe of Vyse/Orchid, Eul's, and wards. </li>
			<li>If you use Force while rolling, you'll get the Force but the Boulder will break apart. If you use a Force Staff while it's revving up,
				you'll get the Force and continue rolling, but you'll need to place the Remnant out of the Force distance otherwise
				your Boulder won't consume the Remnant.</li>
			<li>You can pick up runes while Rolling.</li>
			<li>You can use/target spells while you're in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while
				you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.</li>
			<li>When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle
				from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately
				kick them back along the path you came.</li>
			<li>Rolling Boulder destroys trees along the path that you roll.</li>
			<li>After your Roll starts moving, your path is calculated regardless if you get disabled mid-Roll or not. If you get
				disabled mid-Roll, but you were <i>going to</i> connect on a hero if you kept going, you'll immediately land where
				you would've landed and stun the enemy hero. This can be used to Roll through a Black Hole and stun Enigma
				or Roll through a Chronosphere if you can land on an enemy on the other side.</li>
			<li>Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels when directly targeted on the hero.</li>
			<li>Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an
				enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.</li>
			<li>The disadvantage of recycling is that you end up stacking your total disables on top of each other (some
				of the silence duration is wasted because the enemy is stunned anyway). If you have Remnants to burn,
				stagger your spells.</li>
			<li>The trigger radius on a Remnant from a magnetized unit is larger than the activation/refresh radius to
				Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to un-Magnetized enemies.</li>
			<li>The Magnetize DoT lasts for 6 seconds on an enemy. Space out re-Magnetizations to squeeze out the most
				damage.</li>
			<li>If any one Magnetized target gets silenced from Grip or slowed by Smash, all other Magnetized targets will
				receive the same debuff.</li>
			<li>Rolling into an Enchant Remnant (Agh's skill) will immediately take the hero out of Remnant form.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kaolin Showdown isn't invulnerable inside the Rolling Boulder. He's fully targetable and can be stunned
				and damaged as expected.</li>
			<li>When killing an Earth Spirit, stand in front of his Rolling Boulder and make him hit you to prevent him
				from Rolling out of the situation.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit cannot cast Rolling Boulder when rooted or leashed.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit needs a lot of time to recharge Remnants after a team fight. Keep high aggression when
				playing against an Earth Spirit.</li>
			<li>Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and
				they're not.</li>
			<li>Magnetize can be dispelled.</li>
