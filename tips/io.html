		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>This is as much of a guide to playing <i>with</i> Io as it is actually playing Io. It's nearly
				   impossible to Wisp properly if your teammates have no idea how the hero works. Actually, just
				   teammate singular. Io only really needs one competent core-playing teammate to be effective.</li>
			<li>Tether can be cast on any allied unit within 1800 range. If Io is over 700 units away from a Tether
				target, it'll move in until it's 300 units away from the target. The reason this is important is that
				when you see an allied Io trying to escape and they can't find any allied creeps to link, get close to
				them, <i>but not too close.</i> Once Io has you Tethered you can start moving away.
			</li>
			<li>You can channel a TP while flying to a Tether target.
			</li>
			<li>When traveling to a linked target, Io breaks trees in a 350 radius around where it lands. Use this to
				create easier jungle paths or to break trees for sight.
			</li>
			<li>Tether+Overcharge can be used on non-hero units. Amusing targets include the Spirit Bear, Warlock's
				Golem, Beastmaster's Boar, Necrobook creeps, and siege creeps.
			</li>
			<li>Io copies the movespeed of the Tethered target.
			</li>
			<li>You want to cast Spirits ~15 seconds before Relocating so that you can cast them again mid-gank.
			</li>
			<li>Activate Spirits in the fountain before TPing out. They last forever, so it's basically a free cast.
			</li>
			<li>You can toggle Spirits Movement while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>Tether and Spirits can hit invisible heroes.</li>
			<li>While scouring the map/minimap for a destination to Relocate to, right click your Tethered ally. This'll
				make Io follow the hero around so you don't encounter the awkward, "Alright this guy? Okay we're
				Reloc--WAIT WHAT THE HELL WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DID YOU GO TO FARM ANCIENTS? I SAID WE WERE RELOOHHHH
				NNNNNOOOOO."
			</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/41676162">Pay attention to the timer on Relocate and ask
				your teammate for consent before taking them back.</a>
			</li>
			<li>You can double-tap Relocate to automatically target to the fountain.</li>
			<li>Bane's Nightmare, Shadow Demon's Disruption, OD's Astral Imprisonment, Wyvern's Cold Embrace, and
				self-Eul's on Io can prevent Relocate from going off after being cast. I guess you could use this for
				some sick BKB baiting in the late game. Or maybe checking the Rosh pit without going into it.
			</li>
			<li>Shadow Amulet's invisibility <i>won't break</i> when returning back from a Relocate. You don't need to
				do anything fancy like try to time the return during the fade time, you just need to make sure you hit
				the Stop key at some point while invisible otherwise Io will start auto attacking the nearest enemy upon
				returning. Since Glimmer Cape is a pretty good item on Io, this is an interaction worth mentioning.
			</li>
			<li>The "Attack Tethered Ally's Target" talent will make Io attack any unit that gets hit with whatever is considered
				a 'right click' from the ally. This means Io will attack all enemies hit by Medusa's Split Shot, Gyro's Flak Cannon and Agh's Side Gunner,
				Pangolier's Swashbuckle, and all other targets of <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Attack_damage#Instant_attacks">instant attacks.</a>
			</li>
			<li>Nothing can stop Io from attacking with the "Attack Tethered Ally's Target" talent. Doesn't matter if Io is ethereal, disarmed, stunned,
				slept, or anything else you could think of. If the Tether partner launches an attack, Io will launch an attack.</li>
			<li>Io, Clinkz, and Pangolier are the only heroes in the game that don't have to turn to cast items.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Tethering heroes is unnatural I tell you hwat. <a target="_blank" href="./assets/media/joke/joketips/iotether.png">Many people
				suggest killing Io first in engagements</a> and that's all well and good, but a good Io will bait you
				into awful positions when attempting to kill the medic. The next best thing is forcing Io to separate
				from his ally and break the Tether. Remember that two different people are playing these heroes, so force them to separate.</li>
			<li>If you disable Io while it's flying towards a Tethered target, you'll cancel the movement from Tether and keep Io in place.
			</li>
			<li>Spirits don't provide vision as they circle, but they will provide vision if they explode on a
				hero.
			</li>
			<li>Keep a close eye on your minimap when playing against an Io. If Relocate is cast, you'll see a bright
				red TP icon on your minimap at the destination.
			</li>
			<li>Just look at the clock, man. I see so many players try to freestyle Relocation return punishes. Do you
				have a Rosh timer method? Press that as soon as you see the red TP circle effect disappear. Then you
				have 12 seconds to pull out your solar powered calculator, turn on a light, grab a drink, and do the
				math.
			</li>
			<li>Stunning/rooting/banishing/hexing/cycloning/silencing Io during the pre-cast of Relocate will prevent Relocate from going off,
				<i>but only if the disabling debuff is on Io when the actual teleport is supposed to trigger.</i> This is one of the
				main reasons why Wisps always Tether their ally at the last possible moment when trying to Relocate
				evacuate them from a fight. If you're focusing an enemy and you see Wisp eyeballing your target, try to
				save a disable to intercept the Relocate.
			</li>
			<li>Remember that Io gets a small radius of flying vision around a Relocate destination, so if you drop a Chronosphere or
				something in advance, Io may just break the Tether and travel alone.
			</li>
			<li>Spells that take advantage of enemies in close quarters can be effective against Relocates like Ice Path,
				Winter's Curse, Paralyzing Cask, or Chain Frost.</li>
			<li>Urn and Spirit Vessel are invaluable against Io lineups. Urn can be placed on Io to break any consumable regen like Bottle
				or a self-Urn the hero may be using to heal a Tether target. Spirit Vessel can be placed directly on the Tether target to
				reduce the amount of HP received from Io.
			</li>
