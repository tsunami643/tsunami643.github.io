		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>This is as much of a guide to playing <i>with</i> Io as it is actually playing Io. It's nearly
				impossible to Wisp properly if your teammates have no idea how the hero works. Actually, just
				teammate singular. Io only really needs one competent core-playing teammate to be effective.</li>
			<li>If Io is over 700 units away from a Tether
				target, it'll move in until it's 300 units away from the target. The reason this is important is that
				when you see an allied Io trying to escape and they can't find any allied creeps to link, get close to
				them, <i>but not too close.</i> Once Io has you Tethered you can start moving away.
			</li>
			<li>Io can start channeling a TP while flying to a Tether target.
			</li>
			<li>When traveling to a Tether target, Io breaks trees in a small radius around where it lands. Use this to
				create easier jungle paths or to break trees for sight.
			</li>
			<li>Tether DPS works on creeps. Try to arrange your heroes in a way that the line is damaging neutrals or lane creeps
				when free farming.
				<ul><li>Tether DPS also works on Rosh. It's especially worthwhile to keep Rosh in the Tether AoE since Tether also significantly slows
					enemy attack speeds.</li></ul>
			<li>Tether+Overcharge can be used to buff non-hero units. Amusing targets include Warlock's Golem, Beastmaster's Boar, and siege creeps.
			</li>
			<li>Io copies the move speed of the Tethered target. This means teammates should generally apply move speed buffs to the Tethered
				target, not Io.
			</li>
			<li>Even when you're at full HP as Io, any regen you receive will still be sent to your Tethered ally. For example, if you use a Healing Salve
				at max HP, your ally will still benefit from the multiplied regen.
				<ul><li>It's <i>always</i> better to cast Holy Locket on yourself, not on your Tethered target. The heal buff applies to your hero and then that amount gets
					multiplied into your Tethered ally.</li></ul>
			<li>Dagon's active instakills any non-ancient creep. Dagon also heals the caster for a percentage of the damage dealt, which, for an instakill,
				is equal to the current HP of the creep. It's a corny strategy, but you could theoretically Dagon full HP creeps to provide
				a burst heal to your Tethered ally.</li>
			<li>You want to cast Spirits ~15 seconds before Relocating so that you can cast them again mid-gank.
			</li>
			<li>Activate Spirits in the fountain before TPing out. The Spirits last for a while, so it's basically a free cast.
			</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>With Agh's Scepter, you can manually explode your Spirits by pressing the spell hotkey.
				Useful for quick burst damage when farming creeps.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Spirits Movement while channeling a TP.</li>
			<li>Tether and Spirits can hit invisible heroes.</li>
			<li>While scouring the map/minimap for a destination to Relocate to, right click your Tethered ally. Assuming you have the
				"Right Click Allies: Follow/Deny (not Attack)" setting enabled, right clicking an ally makes your hero follow that ally around
				so you don't encounter the awkward, "Alright this guy? Okay we're Reloc--WAIT WHAT THE HELL WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DID YOU GO TO
				FARM ANCIENTS? I SAID WE WERE RELOOHHHH NNNNNOOOOO."
			</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the timer on Relocate and ask your teammate for consent before taking them back.</li>
			<li>You can double-tap Relocate to automatically target the fountain.</li>
			<li>When trying to Relocate save an ally that you're not currently Tethered to, save the Tether for the last possible second before
				the Relocate goes off. The advantages of delaying the Tether are your Relocate-out position will be further from the fight and
				there is less possibility of you getting disabled during the Relocate cast which would cancel it.
			</li>
			<li>Relocate provides a small radius of flying vision around the cast location during the delay.</li>
			<li>Allied Banishes, cyclones, and Bane's Nightmare or Winter Wyvern's Cold Embrace can prevent Relocate
				from going off after being cast. I guess you could use this for some sick BKB baiting in the late game?
				Or maybe checking the Rosh pit without going into it?
				<ul><li>An allied Snapfire's Agh's Scepter Gobble Up can even save Io from a Relocate <i>return</i>
					which differs from other similar Banishes.</li></ul>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Attack Tethered Ally's Target" talent will make Io attack any unit that gets hit with whatever is considered
				a 'right click' from the ally. This means Io will attack all enemies hit by Medusa's Split Shot, Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon and Agh's Scepter Side Gunner,
				Pangolier's Swashbuckle, and all other targets of <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attacks.</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Tethering heroes is unnatural, I tell you hwat.</i> <a target="_blank" href="./assets/media/joke/joketips/iotether.png">Many people
				suggest killing Io first in engagements</a> and that's all well and good, but a good Io will bait you
				into awful positions when attempting to kill the medic. The next best thing is forcing Io to separate
				from his ally and break the Tether. Remember that two different people are playing these heroes, so force them to separate.</li>
			<li>If you disable Io while it's flying towards a Tethered target, you'll cancel the movement from Tether and keep Io in place.
			</li>
			<li>Spirits don't provide vision as they circle, but they will provide vision if they explode on a
				hero.
			</li>
			<li>Keep a close eye on your minimap when playing against an Io. If Relocate is cast, you'll see a bright
				red TP icon on your minimap at the destination.
			</li>
			<li>Just look at the clock, man. I see so many players try to freestyle Relocation return punishes. Do you
				have a Rosh timer method? Press that as soon as you see the red TP circle effect disappear. Then count to 12.
			</li>
			<li>Stunning/rooting/leashing/banishing/hexing/cycloning Io during the pre-cast of Relocate will prevent the spell from going off. This is one of the
				main reasons why Wisps always Tether their ally at the last possible moment when trying to Relocate
				evacuate them from a fight. If you're focusing an enemy and you see Wisp eyeballing your target, try to
				save a disable to intercept the Relocate.
			<ul><li>Applying a fear/silence on Io can also prevent Relocate from going off, <i>but only if the disabling debuff is on
				Io when the actual teleport is supposed to trigger.</i></li>
			<li>Taunts are the only type of disable that does not prevent Relocate from going off at any point of the Relocate cast.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You can also Eul's cyclone the enemy hero that Io is trying to save. Io can't target cycloned units with Tether, so you can outplay an
				Io who's trying to go for a last second Tether+Relocate save with this. Your team may get mad at you for Eul'sing an enemy who may have been stunned,
				but explain your reasoning after you win the fight and they'll realize you're actually a genius.
			</li>
			<li>Remember that Io gets a small radius of flying vision around a Relocate destination, so if you drop a Chronosphere or
				something in advance, Io may just break the Tether and travel alone.
			</li>
			<li>Spells that take advantage of enemies in close quarters can be effective against Relocates like Jakiro's Ice Path,
				Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, or Lich's Chain Frost.</li>
			<li>Kunkka's X Marks can help prevent an enemy from getting Relocated out of a fight.</li>
			<li>The HP Io gives to the Tethered target fall under two categories:
				<ul><li><b><i>Health Restoration</i></b> - This is the passive HP/s Io gives (the + number that goes up in the HP bar) and the buffed Overcharge number.
					<li>Items that can reduce health restoration: Orb of Frost/Corrosion and the "Crippling Crossbow" and "Jidi Pollen Bag" neutral item artifacts.</li>
					<li>Spells that can reduce health restoration: Abaddon's Withering Mist innate, Broodmother's Spin Webs with "Necrotic Webs" facet, Dragon Knight's "Frost Dragon" facet,
						Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, Slark's Saltwater Shiv, and <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/index.php?title=Restoration_Manipulation#Restoration_Classification">a few others.</a></li>
					<li><b><i>Incoming Heals</i></b> - These are the burst heals Io gives, like from Magic Wand, Holy Locket, or Healing Lotuses.</li>
					<li>Items that can reduce health restoration AND incoming heals: Spirit Vessel, Eye of Skadi, and Shiva's Guard.</li>
					<li>Spells that can reduce health restoration AND incoming heals: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom.</li>
				</ul>
