		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bounces from Moon Glaives don't actually behave as right clicks, but rather as a passive spell. As a result,
				the Glaives will ignore evasion and won't proc things like Centaur's Retaliate. <i>However,</i> unlike other spells,
				spell damage amp or spell lifesteal doesn't work on Glaives and Glaives are reduced by damage block.</li>
			<li>Lunar Blessing gives you bonus night vision. If you see an enemy at night just at the edge of your vision,
				there's a good chance they can't see you yet.</li>
			<li>Eclipse is married to Lucent Beam. If for some reason you're keeping Lucent Beam at low levels, Eclipse
				is going to be useless.</li>
			<li>Eclipse doesn't continue after you die, so don't use it if you're getting ganked just because you're
				angry that you got caught.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>An Agh's Scepter Eclipse (ground or self targeted) ends prematurely if Luna dies. When cast on an ally,
				it ends prematurely if that ally dies.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Eclipse only provides ground vision, not flying vision, around its AoE.</li>
			<li>Eclipse has a fairly long cast time. It's okay to cast it earlier than you need it just so you can get
				it off before getting perma-stunned.</li>
			<li>Since the cast time is so long, enemies will often be able to evacuate the area before any Beams
				even connect. Try to cast the spell in a way where the enemy can't easily leave once they see you like from fog,
				or behind trees, or after the enemy team is fully committed to a fight.</li>
			<li>Eclipse turns the map to night for 10 seconds. If you see a bunch of enemies moments away from ganking
				you and you really don't want to die, you can use Eclipse's night to potentially hide yourself from
				enemy vision.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Luna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game, so as tempting as it can be to dive her in the
				early game, it can be risky without disables.</li>
			<li>Luna has 1800 night vision once Lunar Blessing is maxed, so you need to be sneaky if you're trying
				to gank her at night.</li>
			<li>Once your tier 3 tower goes down, get ready to enter Glaive City. Not only will this damage everything
				in sight, but there is a high probability that your Blink Dagger is going to get disabled from an errant
				Glaive. Stand as far as possible from your structures if you're planning on Blink initiating.</li>
			<li>Eclipse can be a terrifying spell, but there are ways to deal with it. Summons and illusions are a good way
				to mitigate the risk of eating Beams. Blade Mail could potentially kill her if you're tanky and she doesn't have a BKB.</li>
