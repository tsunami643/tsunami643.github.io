		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bloodrage can be cast on creep-hero units like Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear,
				Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.</li>
			<li>Blood Rite provides ground vision around its AoE.</li>
			<li>Enemies can't easily use Blink Dagger if they're Ruptured. It has a pretty long cast range and the
				debuff lasts a ridiculously long time, so it can be useful to mess with Blinks from an initiator
				like Tidehunter or Magnus before a team fight begins.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Blood Mist can be toggled while channeling TPs.</li>
			<li><span class="talent"></span>If you take the "2 Rupture charges" talent, be aware that multiple casts of Rupture don't stack  on the same target, it'll just refresh the duration. What'd you expect,
				they'll bleed twice as hard? C'mon now.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TP scroll. Seriously. Just TP out if he's ganking you. None of his spells have stuns/roots/leashes to cancel it.</li>
			<li>If you can exceed more than 1300 range in one server tick, Rupture won't damage you. This is why you don't take damage from Rupture
				after TPing back to base, but this is also relevant if you're playing Queen of Pain (move immediately after Blinking max range
				and you won't take Rupture damage) or have cast range increasing abilities on Blink Dagger.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel is so outrageously value against a BS, it's not even funny. Vessel him before he heals
				off a target dying and watch him struggle to stay alive in team fights. Skadi and Shiva's can also prevent him
				from healing as much.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing, such as from Thirst.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail can be good if you're tanky, especially if he Ruptures you.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb can provide a lot of value when placed on your carry since BS will feel uneasy about initiating a team fight
				with Rupture.</li>
			<li>Kiss juking goodbye if there's a Bloodseeker on the enemy team. Once a match you'll find yourself
				wondering, "HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS THERE???" Then you'll look up and realize that Bloodseeker was
				giving his team global vision of your ass when you're under 25% HP thanks to his Thirst passive.</li>
				<ul><li>Thirst vision provides true sight as well. Not even invisibility will save you at critical HP.</li></ul>
			<li>Be extremely careful when jungling at low HP against an enemy Bloodseeker. If he detects you with Thirst vision, you can be sure
				that his whole team will be quickly converging on your location to score a kill.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>If Bloodseeker has an Agh's Scepter, the overheal barrier can purged off with spells like Enchantress's Enchant,
				Oracle's Fortune's End, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, or items like Nullifier or Eul's Scepter.</li>
