		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Sprout gives flying vision for some reason. Like a huge radius of flying vision. Use Sprout to scout
				enemies who are juking in a jungle, counter ward cliffs, or to get that last hit on the flying courier
				who just flew out of vision.</li>
			<li>Target your Sprout during your TP animation when you're going in for a gank. You'll cast it as soon as
				you're in range and have vision of the target, rather than fumbling around the moment you get there and
				inadvertently trapping your allies. The spell can be hero targeted, so you only rarely need to skillshot
				it (only when the enemy is spell immune, or you're trying to guess where an invis hero went).</li>
			<li>Carry a TP scroll. It makes it incredibly difficult for you to get punished for TPing in to snipe
				couriers, killing fleeing heroes, or pulling down a tower's pants and backdooring it.</li>
			<li>95% of the raising the roof animation for Teleport won't break the invis granted by Shadow Blade.</li>
			<li>You can use Teleportation to mindgame enemies. If you see your teammate is getting ganked, start casting
				a TP right on top of the enemies, even if you only have 10 HP, just to freak them out. The animation is
				pretty obvious and is long enough that you can easily cancel it.</li>
			<li>When ganking in the early game, TP into places out of vision like inside the side shop or behind the
				lane.</li>
			<li>How to avoid dying as Prophet: Step 1: Run away a little bit. Step 2: Cast Sprout on yourself (you can
				use double tap to self cast if it's enabled) so no one can see you during your private time. Step 3:
				Double tap the TP hotkey to automatically target the fountain. Step 4: Do it all over again in 45
				seconds because the enemy never learns.</li>
			<li>If you're TPing from the fountain to start pushing a lane, queue up a Nature's Call on the nearest group
				of trees. You should be able to recoup most of the mana lost with residual Fountain regen.</li>
			<li>Treants are great units for cutting off a creep wave. Just send one up ahead to lead the enemy creeps on
				a wild goose chase while you continue beating on the tower.</li>
			<li>Learn how his ult works and how to maximize the damage on high priority targets. You typically only want
				to cast it if you can see heroes on the minimap and at least 2 lanes have creeps fighting at the moment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>QUELLING BLAAAAADE. Also Tangoes. Few spells can lose effectiveness so dramatically from such cheap
				items. If your ally is Sprouted, be a pal and use one of these to get them out. Learn which spells can
				break trees as well (especially the not so obvious ones like Tether, Split Earth, Light Strike Array,
				Tombstone, etc). These can also come in handy to invade NP's little home when he Sprouts himself to TP
				out. Keep at least 1 Tango or my QB on hand in the mid game if you don't have any of these spells.</li>
			<li>Keep a close eye on your courier and get it up and flying ASAP against an enemy Prophet. Save the haste
				for when it's on its way back to the fountain.</li>
			<li>If you see an ult bouncing around, back out of the lane to get out of vision and stay there for a few
				seconds. If you're wondering how his ult just hit you in the middle of your jungle, either Riki is
				stalking you or they have a ward.</li>
			<li>Save your stun/silence for the end of his Teleport animation. He's disabling himself for free while he's
				mid-animation. Let him think that he's going to get out while you're whittling him down with auto
				attacks, then disable his cast at the last moment.</li>
			<li>Prophet faces in the direction that he's TPing. While not always useful, if you see him Teleporting you
				can warn your teammates where he's probably traveling to.</li>
