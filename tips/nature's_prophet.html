		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Sprout trees give double regen when eaten by Tangoes, just like Iron Branch trees. However, enemies can also
				benefit from eating your trees the same way.</li>
			<li>Sprout gives a small radius of flying vision around the trees when cast. Use Sprout to scout
				enemies who are juking in a jungle, counter ward cliffs, or to get that last hit on the flying courier
				who just flew out of vision.</li>
			<li>Target your Sprout during the Teleport animation when you're going in for a gank. You'll cast it as soon as
				you're in range and have vision of the target, rather than fumbling around the moment you get there and
				inadvertently casting it on the ground right next to an enemy.</li>
			<li>Sprout can be hero targeted, so you should only be ground targeting it if the enemy is spell immune, has a Linken's Sphere,
				or if you're trying to guess where an invis hero went.</li>
			<li>You can Sprout enemy towers to 'blind' them. However, whenever a unit or structure is attacked it automatically
				gets vision of the attacker, so this is only useful if you need to briefly reduce enemy vision around a tower
				for some reason.</li>
			<li>You can also Sprout buildings defensively. The same rules apply about vision automatically being given for an attacker,
				so you can't stop your towers from being seen. Your Ancient and your barracks don't attack, though. So if you Sprout the center of those
				structures, the enemy can't "see" it and can't attack it.</li>
			<li>Always carry a TP scroll. A scroll gives you an immediate escape after you finish Teleporting in to snipe a
				courier, kill a fleeing hero, or cut the creep wave.</li>
			<li>Courier sniping is relevant all game long. Consider buying your own observer wards and planting them in
				areas that can spot couriers traveling to and from the fountain or secret shop.</li>
			<li>Couriers respawn after 120 seconds.</li>
			<li>95% of the raising the roof animation for Teleport will stay under the invis granted by Shadow Blade or an invis rune.</li>
			<li>You can use Teleportation to mindgame enemies. If you see your teammate is getting ganked, start casting
				a Teleport right on top of the enemies, even if you only have 10 HP, just to freak them out. The animation is
				pretty obvious and is long enough that you can easily cancel it.</li>
			<li>When ganking in the early game, Teleport into places out of vision like inside the side shop or behind the
				lane.</li>
			<li>You can teleport into the treelines around the enemy base to safely/sneakily
				<a href="https://imgur.com/a/NBMJs">plant high ground wards before a siege.</a></li>
			<li>How to avoid dying as Prophet: Step 1: Run away a little bit. Step 2: Cast Sprout on yourself (you can
				use double tap to self cast if it's enabled) so no one can see you during your private time. Step 3:
				Double tap the Teleport hotkey to automatically target the fountain. Step 4: Do it all over again in a minute
				because the enemy never learns.</li>
			<li>Treants are great units for distracting a creep wave. Just send one up ahead to lead the enemy creeps on
				a wild goose chase while you continue beating on the tower.</li>
			<li>Learn how Wrath of Nature works and how to maximize the damage on high priority targets. It has the same number of bounces at all levels, so 
				you typically want to cast it if you can see heroes on the minimap and at least 2 lanes have creeps fighting at the moment.</li>
			<li>Linken's Sphere blocks the entirety of Wrath of Nature if you directly target the spell on the hero, but does nothing if you
				ground target Wrath. This means you can globally pop Linken's if you have vision of a target.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>QUELLING BLAAAAADE. Also Tangoes or Battle Fury. Few spells can lose effectiveness so dramatically from
				such cheap items. If your ally is Sprouted, be a pal and use one of these to get them out. Learn which
				spells can break trees as well (especially the not so obvious ones like Tether, Split Earth, Light Strike Array,
				Tombstone, etc). These can also come in handy to invade NP's little home when he Sprouts himself to Teleport out.
				Keep at least 1 Tango or QB item on hand in the mid game if you don't have any of these spells and late game
				use Force Staff. Tango is especially useful early on since you get double regen from Sprout trees, like Iron
				Branch trees.</li>
			<li>Keep a close eye on your courier. You can protect it with the Shield if Prophet is trying to make a move on it.</li>
			<li>If you see Wrath of Nature bouncing around, back out of the lane to get out of vision and stay there for a few
				seconds. If you're wondering how his ult just hit you in the middle of your jungle, either Riki is
				stalking you or they have a ward.</li>
			<li>Save your stun/silence for the end of his Teleport animation. He's disabling himself for free while he's
				mid-animation. Let him think that he's going to get out while you're whittling him down with auto
				attacks, then disable his cast at the last moment.</li>
			<li>Prophet faces in the direction that he's Teleporting. While not always useful, if you see him Teleporting you
				can warn your teammates where he's probably traveling to.</li>
			<li>Nature's Prophet can't cast Teleportation while rooted/leashed.</li>
