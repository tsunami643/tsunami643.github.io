		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cinder Brew self-attacks can never be lethal.</li>
			<li>Cinder Brew works on Rosh. If you're lucky, he can even bash himself.</li>
			<li>You always gain net movement when casting Drunken Brawler. The speeds always go 40% movement speed bonus in the first, third,
				and fifth second, and a 20% movement speed slow in the second and fourth second.</li>
			<li>Any auras that your hero has will be carried through to your primary Split panda. The primary Split panda order goes from
				Earth -> Storm -> Fire. The primary Split panda's location is also where your hero will return to when the ult ends.</li>
			<li>The Earth Panda deals extra damage to structures and can receive buffs like Alacrity or Bloodlust.</li>
			<li>I don't care what the situation is, the Cyclone on the Storm Panda will always be useful. Cyclone the
				support so that your teammates won't waste time killing that squishy CM when they should be focusing the
				carry. Cyclone that Omniknight so his whole team cries at him for not ulting. Cyclone that PA who
				is slicing everyone to shreds because the rest of her team is locking your team down. Cyclone the roided
				up Sven and waste a whopping 6 seconds of God's Strength. Then when he comes back down, wait two seconds
				for it to come off cooldown and Cyclone his punk ass again.</li>
			<li>After you pick someone to twister, think about Dispelling some Magic.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_buffs">Here's a long list of things you can basic dispel.</a></li>
			<li>Dispel Magic also deals a ton of damage to all summoned units (excluding Lone Druid's Spirit Bear and ward-type units) and illusions.</li>
			<li>Casting the Storm Panda's Dispel Magic on the Cyclone immediately stop the Cyclone. Don't
				stand around watching the enemy spin for the full duration if your team is ready to kill them, just
				dispel it.</li>
			<li>Dispel Magic can also end an enemy self-Eul's.</li>
			<li>The Cyclone lasts extra long against lesser creeps/summons. This combined with the bonus damage to summons on Dispel Magic
				make Brewmaster good at dealing with Necronomicons.</li>
			<li>The Storm Panda's Wind Walk gives free bonus damage on its next attack. You should easily be able to use it multiple
				times during your ult if you pay attention to the cooldown. It's a lot of physical damage that you may have been missing out on.</li>
			<li>Attacks during the fade time of the Wind Walk apply the bonus damage without losing the buff. So technically,
				you could get 4 Wind Walk damage hits in 2 Wind Walk casts.</li>
			<li>The Wind Walk also gives a massive move speed increase on the Storm Panda. Use it if you're trying to
				catch an escaping enemy. Once you catch up, cast the Cyclone. The Cyclone won't end even if your ult ends.</li>
			<li>Late game, Wind Walk will be your main escape mechanism because your Fire Panda
				will go down as soon as someone so much as farts on it, and the Earth Panda goes down surprisingly
				quickly once carries start doling out big single target damage.</li>
			<li>In high ground siege situations, sometimes you can consider suiciding your Earth Panda in the enemy fountain
				after your Storm Panda has already made a break for it.</li>
			<li>Often times you'll be finishing your Primal Split only to have the entire enemy team staring hungrily at your
				Earth Panda, waiting for your return. If you have a Blink Dagger, position your Earth Panda where you can get an
				effective Blink, and start mashing the item hotkey. Just be sure to turn the Spirit to face the direction you want
				to Blink in before Primal Split ends. This will avoid any turn animation delay since Brewmaster faces the same direction
				that the Spirit was last facing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Brew is nearly impossible to kill 1v1 if you're a right clicker in the early/mid game. Between Cinder Brew and Drunken Brawler,
				hitting this guy is a miracle. And that's assuming Primal Split is down.</li>
			<li>Sources of accuracy do not reduce the frequency of self-attacks under Cinder Brew.</li>
			<li>Bashes can proc on self-attacks. MKB pierce and accuracy can proc on self-attacks. Desolator corruption can proc on self-attacks.
				Other items like Crystalys/Daedalus crit, Maelstrom/Mjollnir lightning, Skadi Cold Attack, Diffusal Mana Break, and lifesteal don't
				proc on self-attacks.</li>
			<li>Pretty much every carry should consider getting a BKB early on to deal with the self-attack from Cinder Brew.
				Manta Style, Lotus Orb, and Guardian Greaves can purge the debuff as well.</li>
			<li>Kill the Fire Panda ASAP in the early game. This is the majority of Brewmaster's damage once he splits.</li>
			<li>Unlike Eul's, Brew's Cyclone does not apply any damage when you land, so you can immediately Blink out.</li>
			<li>You can left click the Spirits and check their buffs to see how much time is remaining on the Split.
				This is relevant if you're trying to drop some damage/disables on the Earth Panda to disable Brewmaster's Blink
				as he returns.</li>
			<li>SILENSILSILSILESILENSILENCESILENCE. Dude hates silences and hexes. Primal Split has a cast time and
				hexes and some silences are instant. If you have these on your team he'll likely have to cut his
				Blink->Clap->Cinder->Split combo to just Blink->Split.</li>
