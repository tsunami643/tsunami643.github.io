		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You always get the Brewed Up buff when casting Cinder Brew, your hero does not need to be in the target AoE.</li>
			<li>Know that critical attacks always roll during the beginning of an attack animation. You can't swap into Fire Brawler stance
				and get the crit mid-attack animation.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>However, slowing effects are determined on attack impact. So if you have Agh's Shard, you can swap
				<i>out</i> of Fire Brawler after a critical attack starts and into Void Brawler to also get the slow on impact.</li>
			<li>Any auras that your hero has will be carried through to your primary Split Brewling. The primary Split Brewling order goes from
				Earth -> Storm -> Fire. The primary Split Brewling's location is also where your hero will return to when the ult ends.</li>
			<li>The Earth Brewling deals extra damage to structures and can receive buffs like Invoker's Alacrity or Ogre Magi's Bloodlust.</li>
			<li>I don't care what the situation is, the Cyclone on the Storm Brewling will always be useful. Cyclone the
				support so that your teammates won't waste time killing that squishy Crystal Maiden when they should be focusing the
				carry. Cyclone that Omniknight so his whole team cries at him for not ulting. Cyclone that Phantom Assassin who
				is slicing everyone to shreds because the rest of her team is locking your team down. Cyclone the roided
				up Sven and waste a whopping 6 seconds of God's Strength. Then, when he comes back down, wait two seconds
				for it to come off cooldown and Cyclone his punk ass again.</li>
			<li>After you pick someone to Cyclone, think about Dispelling some Magic.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_buffs">Here's a long list of things you can basic dispel.</a> The dispel
				works on enemies and allies.</li>
			<li>Dispel Magic also deals a ton of damage to all illusions and summoned units (excluding Lone Druid's Spirit Bear,
				clones, and ward-type units).</li>
			<li>Casting the Storm Brewling's Dispel Magic on the Cyclone immediately cancels it. Don't
				stand around watching the enemy spin for the full duration if your team is ready to kill them, just
				dispel it.</li>
			<li>Dispel Magic can also end an enemy self-Eul's.</li>
			<li>The Cyclone lasts extra long against lesser creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>The Storm Brewling's Wind Walk gives free bonus damage on its next attack. You should easily be able to use it multiple
				times during your ult if you pay attention to the cooldown. It's a lot of physical damage that you may have been missing out on.</li>
			<li>Attacks during the fade time of the Wind Walk apply the bonus damage without losing the buff. So technically,
				you could get 4 Wind Walk damage hits in 2 Wind Walk casts. It's fairly easy to do, just make sure you're in range of the enemy
				you're attacking, cast the Wind Walk, and then immediately right click the enemy. The first attack will land with bonus damage
				without removing your invisibility.</li>
			<li>The Wind Walk also gives a massive move speed increase on the Storm Brewling. Use it if you're trying to
				catch an escaping enemy. Once you catch up, cast the Cyclone. The Cyclone won't end even if your ult ends.</li>
			<li>Late game, Wind Walk will be your main escape mechanism because your Fire Brewling
				will go down as soon as someone so much as farts on it, and the Earth Brewling goes down surprisingly
				quickly once carries start doling out big single target damage.</li>
			<li>Often times you'll be finishing your Primal Split only to have the entire enemy team staring hungrily at your
				Earth Brewling, waiting for your return. If you have a Blink Dagger, position your Earth Brewling where you can get an
				effective Blink, and start mashing the item hotkey. Just be sure to turn the Spirit to face the direction you want
				to Blink in before Primal Split ends. This will avoid any turn animation delay since Brewmaster faces the same direction
				that the Spirit was last facing.</li>
			<li>In high ground siege situations, sometimes you can consider sacrificing your Earth Brewling into the enemy fountain
				after your Storm Brewling has already made a break for it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kill the Fire Brewling ASAP in the early game. This is the majority of Brewmaster's damage once he splits.</li>
			<li>Unlike Eul's, Brew's Cyclone does not apply any damage when you land, so you can immediately Blink out.</li>
			<li>You can left click the Spirits and check their buffs to see how much time is remaining on the Split.
				This is relevant if you're trying to drop some damage/disables on the Earth Brewling to disable Brewmaster's Blink
				as he returns.</li>
			<li>SILENSILSILSILESILENSILENCESILENCE. Dude hates silences and hexes. Primal Split has a cast time and
				hexes and some silences are instant. If you have these on your team he'll likely have to cut his
				Blink → Thunder Clap → Cinder Brew → Primal Split combo to just Blink → Primal Split.</li>
			<li>Clockwerk's Battery Assault stun interval is just short enough that Brewmaster is unable to complete his Primal
				Split cast animation.</li>
