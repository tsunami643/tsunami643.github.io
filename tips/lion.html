		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be aware of the advantages of ground targeting Earth Spike. The cast range is about 300 units shorter
				than the actual range of the stun. Ground targeting also makes it possible to thread the needle between
				heroes, allowing you to potentially land the stun on multiple targets.</li>
			<li>That being said, stop ground targeting Earth Spike when you don't have to. Icefrog's such a nice guy, he
				gives you a mostly guaranteed targeting system for free. There is a special circle in hell for Lions who
				skillshot and whiff Earth Spike on solo targets in targetable cast range.</li>
			<li>Earth Spike will be blocked by Linken's on all targets hit by the projectile. Doesn't matter if you ground targeted
				the spell or not. This also means that Lotus Orb will reflect Earth Spike even if it's ground targeted.</li>
			<li>You can stack certain neutral camps with Earth Spike. This only works on <i>some</i> camps,
				however. The reason is because Earth Spike raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights.
				You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the <font face="courier new">-spawnneutrals</font> command with cheats enabled)
				to see which camps work and which ones don't. The timing is extremely close, you have to click the spell at ~59s.</li>
			<li>If you a feel a team fight coming on, keep casting and canceling Hex on their initiator. Hexes have 0
				cast time and the moment your target comes into range (like with a Blink Dagger), the Hex will instantly get
				cast. If you're worried about Magnus RPing your team, group up all juicy-like, bait his Blink, then
				Frogitize him, Cap'n.</li>
			<li>Hex and Mana Drain are simple spells that quickly kill illusions. Early game this isn't really relevant,
				but when Naga Siren or Terrorblade start getting fat, this can be useful. This doesn't work against 'strong' illusions, however.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Agh's Shard Mana Drain on multiple targets makes you even more effective at clearing illusions.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>Despite Agh's Shard Mana Drain turning you spell immune, it does not provide any kind of dispel on your hero.</li>
			<li>You can Mana Drain enemy ranged creeps and many jungle creeps to quickly get mana. Left click on a jungle creep to see if it has mana,
				some don't.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>With Agh's Shard Mana Drain and the "Mana Drain Restores Allies" talent, you can Mana Drain an allied ranged creep
				and the split Mana Drains from the Shard may connect on an enemy hero outside your normal cast range.</li>
			<li>Time your Mana Drains on enemy heroes in lane with last hits. If one of your creeps is about to die,
				start Draining. Either they go for the last hit and lose a bunch of mana, or immediately back off and
				lose the last hit.</li>
			<li>Mana Drain is a cheap and long range way to break Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>Mana Drain provides true sight on the target for its duration.</li>
			<li>You get the Finger of Death bonus damage as long as the target dies within three seconds of getting Fingered. You don't
				have to kill steal everything at 100 HP to get the stack...</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be afraid of this guy. He can kill you with relative ease and makes disabling you seem such a
				breeze. If you see him suddenly start walking towards you, he's probably gearing up to Finger you or
				he's setting up for a gank.</li>
			<li>Mana Drain breaks if you go into fog. If he's Draining you in lane, you may be able to stop the Drain
				quicker by going into tree fog rather than running out of the break distance.</li>
			<li>There is an extremely brief (0.25s) moment after Finger of Death connects before the damage is actually dealt.
				You can dodge the damage with banishes or from something like Eul's or Manta Style if your timing is impeccable.
			</li>
