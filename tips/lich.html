		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>While mana <i>regen</i> doesn't work on Lich thanks to his Death Charge innate, burst mana still works. So items like Mango, Magic Stick/Wand,
				Soul Ring, Arcane Boots, and Healing Lotuses still give mana.</li>
			<li>Frost Shield only reduces damage from right clicks or <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2game/Attack_damage#Instant_Attacks">instant attacks</a>, not physical spell damage.
				It does not reduce damage from tower attacks.</li>
			<li>Frost Shield won't slow or deal damage to units in fog.</li>
			<li>You can cast Frost Shield on creeps.</li>
			<li>You can cast Frost Shield on <i>all</i> towers and buildings.
				<ul><li><span class="talent"></span>If you take the "Frost Shield Provides HP Regen" talent, it can also heal buildings.</li></ul>
			<li>You can cast Frost Shield on ward-type units. In addition to observer/sentry wards, this means things you can also cast it
				on Phoenix's Supernova, Pugna's Nether Ward, or Undying's Tombstone.
			<ul><li><span class="shard"></span>Frost Shield being castable on ward-type units also applies to your Agh's Shard Ice Spire.
				The Frost Shield heals the Ice Spire in addition to its normal behavior.</li>
				<li><span class="talent"></span>The "Frost Shield Provides HP Regen" talent will also provide HP regen to ward type units,
					<i>except</i> Phoenix's Supernova Egg. The HP bar on Egg will refill as if it's healing, but it actually doesn't restore hits.</li></ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/rk49dq/more_fringe_dota_knowledge_than_youd_care_to_know/">Here's a big thesis
				on Frost Shield's obtuse mechanics from December 2021.</a> Is it useful? Absolutely not. But is it impressive? Very.
				No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. It gets the people going.</li>
			<li>You can cast all your other spells during the Sinister Gaze channel. They'll all have instant cast times and don't require you
				to face the target to cast.</li>
			<li>Sinister Gaze lasts longer and deals damage when cast on creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>Targets under Sinister Gaze will ignore pathing. This allows you to draw targets up and down cliffs.</li>
			<li>Since Sinister Gaze locks an enemy's facing direction, you could use a Force Staff offensively to move an enemy even further.
				For some reason, you can't cancel Gaze with Force Staff, however. You'll have to manually end the Gaze, <i>then</i> cast Force Staff.</li>
			<li>Sinister Gaze, like all fears, can cancel enemy channels.</li>
			<li>Sinister Gaze always lasts for the fixed channel duration. This means it ignores status resistance on enemies, but also ignores
				debuff amplification.</li>
			<li><span class="scepter"></span>Agh's Scepter Sinister Gaze allows you to pull targets in fog or even untargetable units,
				like a Dark Willow in Shadow Realm or enemies under a Slark Agh's Shard Depth Shroud.</li>
			<li>Only the first hit of Chain Frost can be blocked by Linken's Sphere. The rest of the bounces will continue and
				deal damage as expected.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>You can target your Agh's Shard Ice Spire with Chain Frost and Frost Shield.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be very careful of how far Sinister Gaze can pull you out of position.</li>
			<li>Frost Shield and Sinister Gaze can both be dispelled with basic dispels.</li>
			<li><span class="shard"></span>If you kill the Agh's Shard Ice Spire, a Frost Blast from Lich will be cast around it on death.</li>
		</ul>
