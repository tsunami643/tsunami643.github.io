    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple Flux casts on the same target fully stack.</li>
      <li>Manipulate creep aggro to get good Fluxes in lane. The search radius for muting Flux is basically melee range,
        so right click an enemy hero to attract their creeps towards you, then Flux 'em. Just don't forget to kill their
        ranged creep first.</li>
      <li>Magnetic Field works fully on towers to provide bonus attack speed and evasion.</li>
      <li>Spark Wraiths trigger on invisible <i>and</i> Smoked units.</li>
			<li>Spark Wraiths provide a small radius of ground vision wherever they're planted. You can use these like temporary TA Traps to provide basic
				vision over choke points or in the Rosh pit.</li>
      <li>You don't need to fully envelope a tower to give it the bonus attack speed and evasion. Place the bubble in a way
        that just barely skims the back of the tower so enemies can't easily stand in it and bypass the evasion.</li>
      <li>The Tempest Double's item cooldowns operate independently of your own. Keep track of its Midas cooldown in the early game
        and its Boots of Travel cooldown in the late game.</li>
      <li>At Necro 3, both the Archer and the Warrior give 200 gold each and 200 experience each. If those numbers mean
        nothing to you, know that Midasing the big creep in a hard camp gives ~300 exp. So while you're turbo leveling with
        the Double's Midas, you're also handing the enemy a ton of experience every time you kamikaze your Doubled Necro creeps.</li>
      <li>However, if Necro creeps time out they won't give any experience (this is true for all summons).</li>
      <li>The same is true for the Double itself. The gold/experience bounty on it is significant, so avoid feeding it to enemies.</li>
      <li>The Tempest Double can pick up and use any rune.</li>
      <li>The Tempest Double can capture outposts.</li>
      <li>Interactions with various items on the Double:
        <ul>
				<li>Doubles cannot duplicate any consumable item (including Bottle).</li>
        <li>Items with charges (Urn, Drum, etc.) copy the Original's charges.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot copy Aegis, Gem, or Rapier. It <i>can</i> copy Refresher, but it can't activate it.</li>
				<li>A Double's BKB time decrements on its own.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot pick up or drop items. You also cannot move items around in the Double's inventory/backpack.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>So what can you do with items?
        <ul>
        <li>Midas is considered core since the item effectively has a 2x multiplier on Zet.</li>
        <li>Double Shivas' is basically 400 magic damage in a 900 radius. The active's slow and passive aura don't stack, however.</li>
        <li>As stated earlier, double Necrobooks is a very common build on Zet.</li>
        <li>Manta can be a safer and more versatile pushing/DPS build. Remember, he's an AGI hero and You+Double+Four illusions under
          two Magnetic Fields can dole out some serious damage.</li>
        <li>In 6.87, the stack duration for Pipe of Insight's Barrier was removed, meaning your team can benefit from the Pipe active as
          often as you have the item available. Then again I'd only recommend building Pipe on Arc if you're against a Zeus, Sand King,
          Leshrac, KotL, Tinker team or something.</li>
        <li>Interestingly, Mek has a 25 second stack limit duration against its 65 second cooldown. I... I don't think MekZet is a good
          idea yet, but I am intrigued.</li>
        <li>A double Dagon 5 can deal 1600 magic damage from 800 range. It can also be completely nullified by someone building BKB or Aeon 
          Disk.</li>
        <li>The debuff from Medallion/Solar Crest does <i>not</i> stack if cast on the same enemy, but it's still an item worth
          considering.</li>
        <li>Tempest Doubles copy the Moon Shard buff if the main hero has one consumed.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
        <li>For the love of god, please stand next to an ally if they're Fluxed and you're nearby. Arc Warden is pretty much 99% single
          target damage. If you jump into the mix to save an ally he's probably not going to even touch you. This is highly relevant when
          going for runes.</li>
        <li>Flux can be muted by standing next to neutral creeps.</li>
				<li>Much like Bloodseeker, Arc Warden has no stuns. If you think you can't survive a surprise Flux gank, just TP out. Unfortunately, the courier
					does not mute Flux, so you still may die to the damage in your fountain.</li>
				<li>In team fights, positioning items like Blink or Shadow Blade can help you isolate him before he gets the opportunity to lay down a bunch of spells.</li>
        <li>The Double cannot duplicate any sources of true sight, so Glimmer Cape can be invaluable for supports or Shadow Blade for carries.</li>
        <li>Dominating or banishing a unit will cancel any Boots of Travel channels on that unit.</li>
        <li>Accuracy does not affect attacks on structures, so MKB or true strike won't help you hit buildings under Magnetic Field.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Field won't provide any evasion to enemies (heroes or buildings) if you're attacking while inside the Field.</li>
        <li>Spark Wraiths cannot be disjointed. Think of it like Skywrath's Arcane Bolt since it also provides vision as it travels towards you.</li>
        <li>Summons, illusions, and dominated creeps can be very useful for tanking Spark Wraith nests.</li>
        <li>Once he gets Tempest Double up and running with Midas, Zet will be spending a lot of his time cycling around neutral camps while his Double
          pushes lanes. It's a running joke, but warding his jungle really is one of the best ways to slow down Arc Warden. Find him and kill him,
          block his camps, or just take his jungle over and hem him out.</li>
        <li>If Zet is going for a zoo build, you'll need AoE damage to deal with him. If you donâ€™t have any good AoE spells to deal with a Necro+Manta siege,
					consider building items like Maelstrom/Mjollnir, Battle Fury, Radiance, Veil, or Shiva's Guard to deal with the onslaught.</li>
				<li>Kill the Double. This is easier said than done in the late game, but it's worth having your team cooperate to slaughter the Tempest since the bounty
					on it is significant and it pushes very quickly if left alone.</li>
        <li>Spells treat the Double like a hero, not like an illusion. Except for interactions that occur when a hero dies, like Bloodstone or Track
          or Duel. Those spells treat the Double like an illusion. Unless the Double <i>wins</i> a Duel. Then it actually can use the bonus damage.
          Unlike an illusion. Hoo boy.</li>
        <li>Silencer can INT steal, Bounty Hunter can Jinada money, and Slark can Essence Shift from the Double. If the Double times out or dies, Slark gets the permanent AGI.
          Clinkz can get permanent Death Pact damage as long as he damages the Tempest Double before it times out or dies.</li>
    </ul>
