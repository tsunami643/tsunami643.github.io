    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple Flux casts on the same target fully stack.</li>
      <li>Manipulate creep aggro to get good Fluxes in lane. The search radius for muting Flux is basically melee range,
        so right click an enemy hero to attract their creeps towards you, then Flux 'em. Just don't forget to kill their
        ranged creep first.</li>
      <li>Magnetic Field works fully on towers to provide bonus attack speed and evasion.</li>
      <li>You don't need to fully envelope a tower in Magnetic Field to give it the bonus attack speed and evasion. Place the bubble in a way
        that just barely skims the back of the tower so enemies can't easily stand in it and bypass the evasion. The easiest way
        to estimate the distance is to left click on the tower, look at the green selection circle on the ground, and cast Magnetic Field
        so that it barely touches the circle.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgn5srIydKg">A precisely placed pair of Magnetic Fields can give you perma-evasion.</a> You
        need to be standing right in the gap between the two for it to work.</li>
      <li>Spark Wraiths trigger on invisible <i>and</i> Smoked units.</li>
			<li>Spark Wraiths provide a small radius of ground vision wherever they're planted. You can use these like temporary TA Traps to provide basic
        vision over choke points or in the Rosh pit.</li>
      <li>Use Spark Wraiths to stack neutral camps.</li>
      <li>If you want to be annoying, consider plopping a Spark Wraith in the middle of the enemy's lane (between towers) before the game starts to mess up
        their block.
      </li>
      <li>The Tempest Double's item cooldowns operate independently of your own. You'll have to keep track of both your Midas cooldowns separately.</li>
      <li>The gold/experience bounty on the Tempest Double is significant, so avoid feeding it to enemies.</li>
      <li>The Tempest Double can pick up and use any rune.</li>
      <li>The Tempest Double can capture outposts.</li>
      <li>Interactions with various items on the Double:
        <ul>
				<li>Doubles cannot duplicate any consumable item (including Bottle).</li>
        <li>Items with charges (Urn, Drum, etc.) copy the Original's charges.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot copy Aegis, Gem, or Rapier. It <i>can</i> copy Refresher, but it can't activate it.</li>
				<li>A Double's BKB time decrements on its own.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot pick up or drop items. You also cannot move items around in the Double's inventory/backpack.</li>
        <li>Any neutral item that has a right click effect with a cooldown won't apply with the Tempest Double. </li>
        </ul>
      <li>So what can you do with items?
        <ul>
        <li>Midas is considered core since the item effectively has a 2x multiplier with the Tempest Double.</li>
        <li>Two Shivas' can be a double magic nuke in a huge radius. The active's slow and passive aura don't stack, however.</li>
        <li>You or your Tempest Double can Eul's each other.</li>
        <li>Pipe of Insight's active does not have a stack limit duration, unlike Mek or Greaves. That being said, you probably shouldn't build Pipe on Arc
          unless you're against a Zeus, Sand King, Leshrac, Queen of Pain, Tinker team or something.</li>
        <li>A double Dagon 5 can deal a ton of magic damage very quickly. It can also be completely negated by someone building BKB or Aeon 
          Disk.</li>
        <li>The debuff from Medallion/Solar Crest does <i>not</i> stack if cast on the same enemy.</li>
        <li>Tempest Doubles copy the Moon Shard buff if the main hero has one consumed.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
        <li>Flux won't deal damage if you're standing near any allied unit (225 range).</li>
        <ul><li>Flux can also be muted by standing next to neutral creeps. Unfortunately, couriers do not mute Flux.</li></ul>
				<li>Much like Bloodseeker, Arc Warden has no stuns. If you think you can't survive a surprise Flux gank, just TP out.</li>
				<li>In team fights, positioning items like Blink or Shadow Blade can help you isolate the real Arc Warden before he gets the opportunity to lay down a bunch of spells.</li>
        <li>The Double cannot duplicate any sources of true sight, so Glimmer Cape can be invaluable for supports or Shadow Blade for carries.</li>
        <li>Dominating or banishing a unit will cancel any Boots of Travel channels on that unit.</li>
        <li>Accuracy does not affect attacks on structures, so MKB or true strike won't help you hit buildings under Magnetic Field.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Field won't provide any evasion to enemies (heroes or buildings) if you're attacking while inside the Field.</li>
        <li>Spark Wraiths cannot be disjointed. Think of it like Skywrath Mage's Arcane Bolt since it also provides vision as it travels towards you.</li>
        <li>Summons, illusions, and dominated creeps can be very useful for tanking Spark Wraith nests.</li>
				<li>Kill the Double. This is easier said than done in the late game, but it's worth having your team cooperate to slaughter the Tempest since the bounty
					on it is significant.</li>
        <li>Spells treat the Double like a hero, not like an illusion. Except for interactions that occur when a hero dies, like Bounty Hunter's Track
          or Legion Commander's Duel. Those spells treat the Double like an illusion. Unless the Double <i>wins</i> a Duel. Then it actually can use the bonus damage.
          Unlike an illusion. Hoo boy.</li>
        <li>Silencer can Glaive INT steal, Bounty Hunter can Jinada money, and Slark can Essence Shift from the Double.</li>
        <li>If Disruptor Glimpses a freshly spawned Tempest Double, it'll immediately get sent back to Arc Warden's fountain since it was "dead" there.</li>
    </ul>
