		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Abuse Torrent's huge cast range. The spell has a very obvious cast animation and will likely get juked
				if the enemy sees you Bellamy salute. Cast it from the fog or high ground or combo it with a ally stun.</li>
			<li>Your hero can be facing in any direction when casting Torrent.</li>
			<li>If you get trapped in trees, you can Torrent the enemy and walk underneath them.</li>
			<li>Torrent deals 8 ticks of damage, making it useful for burning off things like Treant's Living Armor
				or Templar Assassin's Refraction.</li>
			<li>The only aspect of Tidebringer that the primary target gets hit by is the bonus right click damage.
				The cleave damage <i>does not affect the primary target.</i> Since the cleave damage from Tidebringer is an amplified amount of your base attack damage,
				obviously you'd rather waste your 100% damage right click on an unimportant target so that your multiplied damage can cleave onto
				a more important target.</li>
			<li>You can cast X on yourself or an ally before getting teleported somewhere. Use this to quickly go back home,
				get a few Bottle charges or pick up something from the shop, and then quickly come back on the lane.</li>
			<li>If you're playing against enemies with short banishes (SD, Puck, PL, anyone with Eul's) stop-cancel your
				Torrent animation after X-ing to bait out usage of these banishes. Then just wait for the banish to end and continue the combo.</li>
			<li>X Marks the Spot is not dispelled on death, so in theory you can buyback and Return to your X.</li>
			<li>The stun from the Ghostship is nice, but defensively casting the boat to receive the Rum buff for its movespeed and delayed damage
				reduction buffs is invaluable. There's no such thing as a fail boat.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If Kunkka's sword is glowing that means Tidebringer is off cooldown.</li>
			<li>The splash effect on Tidebringer is visible on invisible units. Don't sneak around in front of a Kunkka
				if you're invisible because he will likely wonder why there was a poof of water on nothing.</li>
			<li>Cleave damage, such as from Tidebringer, is reduced by damage block and armor.</li>
			<li>Going spell immune will prevent you from getting Returned from an X. You can also go invulnerable, so Cycloning yourself
				with Eul's or getting banished can dodge the Return, but you need to time it.</li>
			<li>You can also use the Eul's Cyclone tactic on enemy X's. If Kunkka's being coy by X'ing himself or an ally and then going
				massively out of position before getting auto-Returned, try timing a Eul's so that they'll be mid-Cyclone when the X buff
				times out.</li>
